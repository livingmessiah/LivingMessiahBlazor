Why have a Components folder when you can just put those things in the Shared folder?

It was suggected by Ed Charbeneau (https://github.com/EdCharbeneau/) that...
  the components in the Shared folder should be for those in common among your project.
And...
 the components in the Components folder are more global and could be potentially ported to a RCL (Razor Class Library)
