<p style="font-size:1.4em">
	As a member of our community, you might find yourself in one or more of the following situations:
	<ul style="font-size:1.4em">
		<li>A family with younger children, who wants to assure that good memories of Passover are passed down through the generations</li>
		<li>A family with older children (or no children at home) who want to celebrate Passover more traditionally</li>
		<li>A family with plenty of room to share Passover with other guests or another family</li>
		<li>A family without the room to share Passover with others but who are eager to join with another family to prepare and celebrate.</li>
		<li>A family who has celebrated Passover many times in the past and is comfortable hosting others who may be less familiar with the celebration</li>
		<li>A family relatively new to this walk and eager to learn about Passover</li>
		<li>A single-parent family who would like to be involved with another family with children of a similar age to encourage the handing down of good memories</li>
		<li>A small family who would just like to share Passover with others</li>
		<li>A single man or woman who would like to be involved with a larger group or family (as scripture instructs) to celebrate Passover</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<p>
	To help our community plan for the Passover celebrations, we would like to assist in the "match-making" process of putting those with specific needs together with those who can best meet those needs.  With this in mind, please fill out the form below describing your particular situation for Passover and we will assist as best we can in pairing you up with another member of our community that best matches your situation.  It is our goal to make sure that <b>EVERYONE</b> has an enjoyable and memorable Passover.
