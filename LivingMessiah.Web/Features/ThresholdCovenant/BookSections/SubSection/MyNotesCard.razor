		<h5 class="card-title">Background</h5>

		<p class="card-text">
			My name is <b>John Marsing</b> and I am an elder here at <b>Living Messiah</b>.
			These are my notes that I compiled from the teaching given by our congregational leader <b>Mark Webb</b> which he gave on 04/06/2024.
			Living Messiah follows a <a href="https://livingmessiah.com/Parasha">triennial reading of the Torah</a> (called <em>parasha</em> in Hebrew) and on every Shabbat Mark does a teaching on that.
			On this date it was Deuteronomy chapter 4 and in his presentation he read from sections of H. Clay Trumbull's book "Threshold Covenant".
			The video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jQJG4EpL-H8?si=Z8HEhn80KeqJETKX&amp;t=7260">here</a> which starts time-stamp <b>2.01.00</b>

			I took the time to create this document for a couple of reasons.
			<ol>
				<li>The claims in this book are powerful and <i>right in my wheel house</i></li>
				<li>
					I was able to create a compelling <a href="https://myhebrewbible.azurewebsites.net/Article/1561/The-Threshold-Covenant-by-H-Clay-Trumbull">reference document 🔗</a> that could be useful.
					Luckily I found an <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/49216/49216-h/49216-h.htm">on-line source</a> 🔗 source I found of the book (originally written in 1896).
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p class="card-text">
			This reference document has evolved into a page (this page) on Living Messiah's website '<a href="https://LivingMessiah.com/ThresholdCovenant/">LivingMessiah.com/ThresholdCovenant 🔗</a>.
			As of April 2024, the scope of this page is only for part V, sections 1-4.
		</p>

		<p class="card-text">
			My intent is to preserve as much as possible the original work while also injecting my comments, Mark's comments, and adding emphasis, and links to relevant sources.

			<li class="list-group-item">What if "Yehovah's passover <span class="hebrew"> פֶּסַח </span> <sup><b><i>pesach</i></b> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6453/kjv/wlc/0-1/">H6453</a></sup>" was way more than the Angel of death <u>passing over</u> the children of Israel so as to avoid the tenth and final plague?</li>
			<li class="list-group-item">What if the context of Exodus chapter 12, which describes the passover, was a rite that was well known and that by doing a detailed word study of key words one could find a bias in the translation?</li>

		<h5 class="">About me</h5>

		<p class="card-text">
			As a <strong>pro</strong>-nomian Christian,
			a student of <strong>actual</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura"><em>sola scriptura</em></a>
			and one who is skilled at <a href="https://myhebrewbible.azurewebsites.net/Article/PagedList?page=1&filterId=WordStudies">word studies</a>,
			I can appreciate someone like Mr. H. Clay Trumbull doing and showing his work.
		</p>

		<p class="card-text">but there's more...</p>

		<p class="card-text">
			I mention this here because a <a href="https://myhebrewbible.azurewebsites.net/Article/200/Acts-12-4-The-one-and-only-occurrence-of-Easter-in-the-King-James">word study</a>
			that I have done on the King Jame's translation of "<em>Easter</em>" is clearly and unequivocally biased.
			What Trumbull is suggesting is that even in modern day Rabbinical Judaism there is a bias as well.
			Although not nearly as bad as antinomian Christianity it is still significant.
