			It is strange that the Hebrew word for <b>"threshold"</b> (<b><i>saph</i></b>) in this narrative is translated <b>"bason"</b> in our English Bible.
			It is because of this that the identity of the passover sacrifice with the primitive <b>Threshold Covenant</b> is so generally lost sight of.
			This word <b><i>saph</i></b> occurs many times in the Old Testament text, and in nine cases out of ten <sup>the KJC word study ⤵️ suggests more like ≈78%</sup> it is translated <b>“threshold</b>,”
			or <b>“door</b>,” or “<b>door-post</b>,” or the like. 
			It would seem that it should be so translated in this instance.

		Bronze and silver thresholds were often mentioned in the furniture of Babylonian and Assyrian temples;<sup>[551 See pp. 109–111, supra.]</sup>
		and they might well have had mention among the Hebrews.
		It is possible, however, that there was a cavity, as a blood receptacle, in the threshold of houses or temples where sacrifices were so frequent;
		and this would account for the use of the word <i>saph</i> as "bason," even where it referred to the threshold of the door.

			Rabbi Ishmael, a Talmudist, in explaining the passage descriptive of the institution of the passover in Egypt, says: 
			"One dug a hole in the [earthen] threshold, and slaughtered into that,"
