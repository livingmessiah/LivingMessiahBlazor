</div>

<hr class='c008' />

<h3 class='c010'>1. A BLOOD WELCOME AT THE DOOR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  The primitive altar of the family would seem to
  have been the threshold, or door-sill, or entrance-way,
  of the home dwelling-place. This is indicated
  by surviving customs, in the East and elsewhere
  among primitive peoples, and by the earliest historic
  records of the human race. It is obvious that houses
  preceded temples, and that the house-father was the
  earliest priest. Sacrifices for the family were, therefore,
  within or at the entrance of the family domicile.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In Syria and in Egypt, at the present time, when
  a guest who is worthy of special honor is to be welcomed
  to a home, the blood of a slaughtered, or a
  “sacrificed,” animal is shed on the threshold of that
  home, as a means of adopting the new-comer into the
  family, or of making a covenant union with him. And
  every such primitive covenant in blood includes an
  appeal to the protecting Deity to ratify it as between
  <span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>the two parties and himself.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> While the guest
  is still outside, the host takes a lamb, or a goat, and,
  tying its feet together, lays it upon the threshold
  of his door. Resting his left knee upon the bound
  victim, the host holds its head by his left hand, while
  with his right he cuts its throat. He retains his
  position until all the blood has flowed from the body
  upon the threshold. Then the victim is removed,
  and the guest steps over the blood, across the threshold;
  and in this act he becomes, as it were, a member
  of the family by the Threshold Covenant.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The flesh of the slaughtered animal is usually given
  to the neighbors, although in the case of humbler
  persons it is sometimes used for the meal of the guest
  in whose honor it is sacrificed. It may be a larger
  offering than a lamb or a goat, or it may be a smaller
  one. Sometimes several sheep are included in the
  sacrifice. Again, the offering may be a bullock or a
  heifer, or simply a fowl or a pair of pigeons. The more
  costly the gift, in proportion to the means of the host,
  the greater the honor to him who is welcomed.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  As illustrative of this idea, a story is commonly told
  in Syria of a large-hearted man who gave proof of his
  exceptional devotedness to an honored guest. He
  had a horse which he prized as only an Oriental can
  prize and love one. This horse he sent to meet his
  <span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>guest, in order that it might bring him to the home
  of its owner. When the guest reached the house and
  dismounted, he spoke warm words in praise of the noble
  animal. At once the host led the horse to the house
  door, and cut its throat over the threshold, asking the
  guest to step over the blood of this costly offering, in
  acceptance of the proffered Threshold Covenant.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “If you know that one is coming whom you would
  honor and welcome, you must make ready to have
  the blood on the threshold when he appears,” said a
  native Syrian. In case an honored guest arrives unexpectedly,
  so that there is no time to prepare the
  customary sacrifice, salt, as representing blood, may
  be sprinkled on the threshold, for the guest to pass
  over; or again coffee, as the Muhammadan substitute
  for the “blood of the grape,”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> may be poured on it.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Crossing the threshold, or entering the door, of a
  house, is in itself an implied covenant with those who
  are within, as shown by the earlier laws of India. He
  who goes in by the door must count himself, and
  must be recognized, as a guest, subject to the strictest
  laws of hospitality. But if he enters the house in
  some other way, not crossing the threshold, there is
  <span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>no such implied covenant on his part. He may then
  even despoil or kill the head of the house he has
  entered, without any breach of the law of hospitality,
  or of the moral law as there understood.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Illustrations
  of this truth are found in the Mahabharata,
  as applicable to both a house and a city.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> “It is in
  accordance with the strict law of all the law books,”
  of ancient India, “that one may enter his foe’s house
  by <em>a-dvāra</em>, ‘not by door,’ but his friend’s house only
  ‘by door.’”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It would seem to have been in accordance with this
  primitive law of the East that Jesus said: “He that
  entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep,
  but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief
  and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is
  the shepherd of the sheep.... I am the door: by me
  if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in
  and go out, and shall find pasture. The thief cometh
  not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I
  came that they may have life, and may have it
  abundantly.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It is possible that there is an explanation, in this
  law of the doorway, or threshold, of the common
  practice among primitive Scandinavians of attacking
  <span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>the inmates of an enemy’s house through the roof
  instead of by the door;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> also, of the custom in Greece
  of welcoming a victor in the Olympian games into his
  city through a breach in the walls, instead of causing
  him to enter by the gates, with its implied subjection
  to all the laws of hospitality.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> (See <a href='#olympian'>Appendix</a>.)
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Examples of the blood welcome at the threshold
  abound in modern Egyptian customs. When the new
  khedive came to his palace, in 1882, a threshold sacrifice
  was offered as his welcome. “At the entrance to
  the palace six buffaloes were slaughtered, two being
  killed just as the khedive’s carriage reached the gateway.
  The blood of the animals was splashed across
  the entrance, so that the horses’ hoofs and wheels of
  the carriage passed through it. The flesh was afterwards
  distributed among the poor.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When General Grant was at Assioot, on the Upper
  Nile, during his journey around the world, he was
  doubly welcomed as a guest by the American vice-consul,
  who was a native of Egypt. A bullock was
  sacrificed at the steamer landing, and its head was
  laid on one side of the gang-plank, and its body on
  the other. The outpoured blood was between the
  head and the body, under the gang-plank, so that, in
  <span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>stepping from the steamer to the shore, General Grant
  would cross over it. When he reached the house of
  the vice-consul, a sheep was similarly sacrificed at the
  threshold, in such a way that General Grant passed
  over the blood in entering.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It is also said in Egypt: “If you buy a dahabiyeh,”
  and therefore are to cross its threshold for the occupancy
  of your new home on the water, “you must
  kill a sheep, letting the blood flow on the deck, or
  side, of the boat, in order that it may be lucky.
  Your friends will afterwards have to dine on the
  sheep.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> There seems, indeed, to be a survival of
  this idea in the custom of “christening”  a ship at the
  time of its launching, in England and America, a
  bottle of wine–the “blood of the grape”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a>–being
  broken on the bow of the vessel as it crosses the
  threshold of the deep. And a feast usually follows
  this ceremony also.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In Zindero, or Gingiro, or Zinder, in Central Africa,
  a new king is welcomed at the royal residence with
  a bloody threshold offering. “Before he enters his
  palace two men are to be slain; one at the foot of
  the tree by which his house is chiefly supported;
  <span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>the other at the threshold of his door, which is
  besmeared with the blood of the victim. And it is
  said ... that the particular family, whose privilege
  it is to be slaughtered, so far from avoiding it, glory
  in the occasion, and offer themselves willingly to
  meet it.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Arabs in Central Africa, the blood
  welcome of a guest at the threshold of a home is a
  prevailing custom. “The usual welcome upon the
  arrival of a traveler, who is well received in an Arab
  camp, is the sacrifice of a fat sheep, that should be
  slaughtered at the door of the hut or tent, so that the
  blood flows to the threshold.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  On the arrival of strangers among the primitive
  tribes of Liberia, in West Africa, a fowl is killed, and
  its blood is sprinkled at the doorway.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Receiving an honored guest with bread and salt, at
  the threshold of the house he enters, is common in
  Russia. Bread and salt are symbolic, in primitive
  thought, of flesh and blood; and this threshold welcome
  seems to be a survival of the threshold sacrifice.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  To step over or across the blood, or its substitute,
  on the door-sill, is to accept or ratify the proffered
  covenant; but to trample upon the symbol of the
  <span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>covenant is to show contempt for the host who proffers
  it, and no greater indignity than this is known in
  the realm of primitive social intercourse.
</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2.  REVERENCE FOR THE THRESHOLD ALTAR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  The threshold, as the family altar on which the
  sacrificial blood of a covenant welcome is poured out,
  is counted sacred, and is not to be stepped upon, or
  passed over lightly; but it is to be crossed over reverently,
  as in recognition of Him to whom all life belongs.
  “On passing the threshold,” in Arabia, “it is
  proper to say, ‘Bismillah,’ that is, ‘In the name of
  God.’ Not to do so would be looked upon as a bad
  augury, alike for him who enters and for those
  within.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> In Syria the belief prevails “that it is unlucky
  to tread on a threshold.” When they receive
  a new member to their sect, the Bektashi derwishes
  of Syria bring him to the threshold, and prayers and
  sacrifices are offered “on the door-sill.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The khaleefs of Bagdad required all those who
  entered their palace to prostrate themselves on the
  threshold of the gate, where they had inserted a fragment
  of the black stone of the temple at Meccah, in
  order to render it [the threshold] more venerable
  <span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>to those who had been accustomed to press their
  foreheads against it. The threshold was of some
  height, and it was a crime to set foot upon it.” In
  the advice which Nurshivan gives to his son Hormuz,
  he recommends him to betake himself to the threshold
  of the Lord; that is, to the “presence of God,
  in the same fashion in which the poor do, at the gates
  of the rich. ‘Since you are his slave,’ he says, ‘set
  your forehead on his threshold.’”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Hindoos, “the threshold is ... sacred
  in private houses; it is not propitious for a person to
  remain on it; neither to eat, sneeze, yawn, nor spit
  whilst there.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A double welcome is sometimes given to one who
  is in an official position. Thus, a Syrian, who held a
  commission from the chief officer of customs in Upper
  Syria, was surprised at having two sheep sacrificed
  before him as he approached the door of a house east
  of the Sea of Galilee; and he graciously protested
  against the excessive honor shown him. “One sheep
  is to welcome yourself as a man, and the other is to
  welcome you as an officer of the government,” was
  the answer. Loyalty as well as hospitality was indicated
  in these threshold sacrifices.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Sacredness attaches to the threshold in Persia. It
  <span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>must not be trodden on; but it is often kissed by
  those who would step over it.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A man should always cross himself when he steps
  over a threshold in Russia; and, in some portions of
  the realm, it is believed that he ought not to sit down
  on the threshold.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  High sills, or thresholds, so that one must step
  over, and not on, them, are in the houses of Finland,
  and in the houses of many Finns in the United States.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
  The same was true of many Teutonic houses.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  To shake hands across a threshold, instead of crossing
  it, is said, in Finland, to ensure a quarrel.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> To

  under the protection of the family within, and of
  its guardian deity.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The same is true among the
  Magyars.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  The ancient Pythagoreans quoted various maxims,
  supposed to be from the sayings of their great founder,
  as teaching important lessons for all time. In these
  maxims there were indications of a peculiar reverence
  for the threshold and doorway. Thus: “He
  who strikes his foot against the threshold should go
  <span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>back;” it were unsafe to pursue a movement so inauspiciously
  begun. And, again: “The doors should
  be kissed fondly by those who enter or depart.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “Treading on the threshold was ... tabooed by the
  Tatars.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Again, on the other side of the globe, in
  Samoa, to spill water on the door-step, or threshold,
  when food is brought in, is a cause of anger to the protecting
  deity of the family. It may drive him away.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In Europe and in America it is by many counted
  an ill omen to tread upon the threshold of the door
  on entering a house. To the present day, in portions
  of Scotland, the idea popularly prevails, that to tread
  directly upon the boundary lines of division between
  ordinary flagstones is to endanger one’s soul; hence
  the very children are careful to avoid stepping upon
  those lines, in their walking across the courtyards or
  along the streets, in their every-day passing.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Many a person in the United States, who knows
  nothing of any superstition connected with this, avoids,
  if possible, stepping on, instead of over, the cracks or
  seams of a board walk, or even the seams of a carpet.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  All these customs seem to be a survival of the feeling
  that the threshold is sacred as the primitive altar.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>Apart from the reverence for the threshold demanded
  of those who pass over it, there is an obvious
  sanctity of the threshold recognized in the placing of
  images and amulets underneath it, and in the sacrifices
  and offerings placed on it, as a means of guarding the
  dwelling within.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the building of private houses, as well as temples,
  and city gateways, in ancient Assyria, images of
  various kinds and sizes, “in bronze, red jasper, yellow
  stone, and baked earth, ... are buried beneath the
  stones of the threshold, so as to bar the entrance to
  all destructive spirits.” Invocations are graven upon
  these figures.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Herodotus mentions<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> that, in the annual feast in
  honor of the god Osiris, “every Egyptian sacrifices a
  hog before the door of his house” on the evening
  before the festival. Osiris was the god who was the
  judge of the soul after death, and who in a peculiar
  sense stood for the truth of the life to come. Every
  Egyptian desired, above all, to be in loving covenant
  with Osiris, and when he would offer a welcoming
  sacrifice to him, he did so before the door of his
  own house, as before the primitive family altar. That
  it was the <em>blood</em> poured out at the threshold which
  was the essential act of covenanting in this sacrifice to
  <span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>Osiris, is evidenced in the fact that the animal sacrificed
  was not eaten in the family of the sacrificer, but
  was carried away by the swineherd who furnished it.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Bunches of grass dipped in blood, and touched by
  the king, as if made representative of his dignity and
  power, are to-day placed on the threshold, as an offering,
  and as averters of evil, in Equatorial Africa. This
  is known there as an ancient custom. In Uganda,
  “every house has charms hung on the door, and
  others laid on the threshold.” An offering to the
  <em>lubare</em>, or local spirit, must be thrown across the
  threshold, from within the house, before a native
  ventures to leave his home in the morning.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Charms
  for this purpose are kept behind the door.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  One of the requirements in the Vedic law (the sacred
  law of the Hindoos) was, that “on the door-sill (a bali
  must be placed) with a mantra addressed to Antariksha
  (the air),”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> by a house father, in his home;<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> that is,
  that an offering, with an invocation to a deity, should
  be a sacrifice at the threshold altar. Other references
  in the Hindoo laws seem to demand bali offerings
  <span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>“at all the doors, as many as they are,” in a house,
  and evidence the importance and sacredness attaching
  to the doorway.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  The threshold seems to have special reverence in
  Northwestern India, in connection with the seasons
  of seedtime and harvest. At seedtime “a cake of
  cowdung formed into a cup” is placed on the threshold
  of the householder; it is filled with corn, and
  then water is poured over it as a libation to the deities.
  Cowdung is not only a means of enrichment to
  the soil, but it is a gift from the sacred cow, and so, in
  a sense, represents or stands for the life of the cow.
  It is laid on the threshold altar as an offering of life.
  The libation of water is an accompaniment of that
  offering; water is essential to life and growth, and it
  is a gift of the gods accordingly. Seed-sowing is
  recognized as an act which needs the blessing of the
  gods, and on which that blessing is sought in covenant
  relations.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  At early harvest time the first-fruits of the grain-field
  are not taken to the threshing-floor, but are brought
  home to be presented to the gods at the household
  altar, and afterwards eaten by the family, with a portion
  given to the Brahmans. The first bundle of corn
  is deposited at the threshold of the home, and a libation
  <span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>of water is made as a completion of its offering.
  The grain being taken from the ear, of a portion of
  this first-fruits, is mixed with milk and sugar, and
  every member of the family tastes it seven times.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Prabhus of Bombay, at the time of the
  birth of a child, an iron crowbar is placed “along
  the threshold of the room of confinement, as a check
  against the crossing of any evil spirit.” This is in
  accordance with a Hindoo belief that evil spirits keep
  aloof from iron, “and even nowadays pieces of horseshoe
  can be seen nailed to the bottom sills of doors
  of native houses.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Iron seems, in various lands, to
  be deemed of peculiar value as a guard against evil
  spirits, and the threshold to be the place for its efficacious
  fixing.

<p class='c000'>
  Similarly, “in East Bothnia, when the cows are
  taken out of their winter quarters for the first time,
  an iron bar is laid before the threshold, over which

  summer.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a>

  Among the folk customs in the line of exorcism
  and divination in Italy, the threshold has prominence.
  “In Tuscany, much taking of magical medicine is

  sorcery.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> A writer mentions a method of exorcism
  with incense, where three pinches of the best incense,
  and three of the second quality, are put in a row on the
  threshold of the door, and then, after other incense is
  burned within the house in an earthen fire-dish, these
  “little piles of incense on the threshold of the door”
  are lighted, with words of invocation. This process is
  repeated three times over.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  A method of curing a disorder of the wrist prevalent
  in harvest time, in North Germany, is by taking
  “three pieces of three-jointed straw,” and so laying
  them “side by side as to correspond joint by joint,”
  then chopping through the first joint into the block beneath.
  This “ceremony is performed on the threshold,
  and ends with the sign of the cross.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  Observances with reference to the threshold are
  numerous in Russia. “On it a cross is drawn to keep
  off <em>maras</em> (hags). Under it the peasants bury stillborn
  children. In Lithuania, when a new house is being
  built, a wooden cross, or some article which has been
  handed down from past generations, is placed under
  the threshold. There also when a newly baptized
  child is being brought back from church, it is customary
  for its father to hold it for a while over the threshold,
  <span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>‘so as to place the new member of the family
  under the protection of the domestic divinities’
  [bringing it newly into the family covenant at the
  threshold altar].... Sick children, who are supposed
  to have been afflicted by an evil eye, are washed on
  the threshold of their cottage, in order that, with the
  help of the Penates who reside there, the malady
  may be driven out of doors.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  At the annual feast known as “Death Week,”
  among Slavonic peoples, marking the close of winter
  and the beginning of spring, the peasants in rural
  Russia combine for a sacrifice to appease the “Vodyaoui,”
  or aroused water-spirit of the thawing streams.
  They also prepare a sacrifice for the “Domovoi” or
  house-spirit. A fat black pig is killed, and cut into
  as many pieces as there are residents in the place.
  “Each resident receives one piece, which he straightway
  buries under the door-step at the entrance to his
  house. In some parts, it is said, the country folk
  bury a few eggs beneath the threshold of the dwelling

  When a Magyar maiden would win the love of a

</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “Threshold” and “foundation” are terms that are
  <span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>used interchangeably in primitive life. The sacredness
  of the threshold-stone of a building pivots on
  its position as a foundation stone, a beginning stone,
  a boundary stone. Hence the foundation stone of any
  house, or other structure was sacred as the threshold
  of that building. According to Dr. H.V. Hilprecht,
  in the earlier buildings of Babylonia the inscriptions
  and invocations and deposits were at the threshold,
  and later under the four corners of the building; but
  when they were at the threshold they were not under
  the corners, and <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></em>. It would seem from
  this that the corner-stone was recognized as the beginning,
  or the limit, or the threshold, of the building.
  It may be, therefore, that the modern ceremonies at
  the laying of a “corner-stone” are a survival of the
  primitive sacredness of a threshold-laying.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It would seem, moreover, as if the sanctity of the
  threshold as the primitive altar were, in many places,
  in the course of time transferred to the family hearth.
  In the primitive tent the household fire was at the
  entrance way, as it is in the tents of the East to-day.
  Where Arabs have camped on an Eastern desert, the
  place of the shaykh’s tent can always be known by
  the blackened hearthstones at its entrance, or threshold,
  where he welcomed guests to the hospitality of
  his tribe and family by the sharing of bread and salt,
  <span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>or by the outpouring of the blood of a slaughtered
  lamb or kid.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  If, indeed, the earliest dwelling of man was a cave,
  rather than a tent, the household fire was still at its
  entrance; and the threshold was the hearthstone.
  When, in the progress of building-changes, the hearthstone
  was removed to the center of the building, or
  of the inner court, its sanctity went with it, as the
  place of the family fire. Thus, for example, in Russia,
  the Domovoi, or household deity, who is honored and
  invoked at the threshold, “is supposed to live behind
  the stove now, but in early times he, or the spirits of
  the dead ancestors, of whom he is now the chief representative,
  were held to be in even more direct relations
  with the fire on the hearth; as were the Penates
  of the Romans, who were sometimes spoken of as at
  the threshold, and again as at the hearth.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  A recognition of the peculiar sacredness of the
  threshold is shown, in different lands, by the popular
  unwillingness to have the dead carried over it on the
  way to burial. In India, the body of one dying in

  over the threshold. The house wall must be broken
  for its removal.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> When Chinese students are attending

<h3 class='c010'>3. THRESHOLD COVENANTING IN THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  Marriage customs in various parts of the world, in
  ancient and modern times, illustrate this idea of the
  sacredness of the threshold as the family altar.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>In portions of Syria, when a bride is brought to her
  husband’s home, a lamb or a kid is sacrificed on the
  threshold, and she must step across the outpoured
  blood.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> This marks her adoption into that family.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the wide-spreading ʾAnazeh Bed´ween, the
  most prominent and extensive tribe of desert Arabs,
  whose range is from the Sinaitic Peninsula to the
  upper Desert of Syria, “when the marriage day is
  fixed, the bridegroom comes with a lamb in his arms
  to the tent of the father of his bride, and then, before
  witnesses, he cuts its throat. As soon as the blood
  falls upon the earth [and the earth is the only threshold
  of a tent], the marriage ceremony is regarded as
  complete.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> “In Egypt, the Copts sacrifice a sheep as
  the bride steps into the bridegroom’s house, and she
  is compelled to step over the blood which flows upon
  the threshold in the doorway.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> It is evident, moreover,
  that this custom is not confined to the Copts.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Blood on the threshold, as an accompaniment of a
  marriage, is still counted important among Armenian
  Christians in Turkey. After the formal marriage ceremony
  at the church, the wedded pair, with their friends,
  proceed to the bridegroom’s home. “At the moment
  <span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>of their arrival a sheep is sacrificed on the threshold,
  over the blood of which the wedding party steps to
  enter the house.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the island of Cyprus, a bridegroom is borne to
  the house of his bride on the wedding morning, in a
  living chair formed by the crossed hands of his neighbor
  friends. Dismounting at her door, “as he is about
  to pass in, a fowl is brought and held down by head
  and feet upon the threshold of the door; the bridegroom
  takes an axe, cuts off the head, and only then
  may he enter.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Like customs are found among yet more primitive
  peoples. Thus, for instance, with the western
  Somali tribes, in east Central Africa: “On reaching
  the bridegroom’s house a low-caste man sacrifices a
  goat or sheep on the threshold; and the bride steps
  over it;” and again when the bridegroom returns from
  his devotions at a neighboring <em>masjid</em> (a place of
  public prayer) to claim his bride, as he reaches his
  threshold, “another goat is sacrificed, and he steps
  over it in the same way as his bride.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Again the
  bridegroom himself brings the bride from her father’s
  hut to his own, accompanied by young men and
  maidens dancing and singing. “On reaching the new
  <span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>hut, the bride holds a goat or sheep in the doorway,
  while the bridegroom cuts its throat in the orthodox
  manner with his <em>jambia</em> (long knife). The bride dips
  her finger in the blood, smears it on her forehead,
  ... and then enters the <em>gúrí</em>, stepping over the blood.
  The bridegroom follows her, also stepping over the
  blood, and is accompanied by some of his nearest
  male relatives.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There are traces of such customs, also, among the
  natives of South Africa,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> and elsewhere.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Besides the bloody sacrifices at the threshold, in
  the marriage ceremony, there are, in different countries,
  various forms of making offerings at the threshold,
  and of surmounting obstacles at that point, as an
  accompaniment of the wedding covenant. All these
  point to the importance and sanctity of the threshold
  and doorway in the primitive mind.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A bride, in portions of Upper Syria, on reaching her
  husband’s house, is lifted up so that she can press
  against the door-lintel a piece of dough, prepared for
  the purpose, and handed to her at the time. This
  soft dough, thus pressed against the plastered or clay
  wall, adheres firmly, and is left there as long as it
  will remain. The open hand of the bride stamps the
  <span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>dough as it is fixed in place, and in some cases the
  finger points are pricked before the stamping, so that
  the blood will appear as a sign manual on the cake
  of dough.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  When a bride reaches the door of her husband’s
  house, among the fellaheen of Palestine, a jar of water
  is placed on her head. She must call on the name of
  God as she crosses the threshold; and, at the same
  moment, her husband strikes the jar from her head,
  and causes the water to flow as a libation.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Wallachians there is a marriage rite,
  said to be of Latin origin, because there was a similar
  rite among the old Latins. The Wallachian bride is
  borne on horseback, with an accompanying procession,
  to the house of the bridegroom. “At the moment
  when the betrothed maiden dismounts from her steed,
  and is about to cross the threshold, they present to
  her butter, or sometimes honey, and with this she
  smears the door-posts.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  An observer says of this rite: “For the same reason
  among the Latins, the word for wife, <em>uxor</em>, originally
  <em>unxor</em>, was derived from the verb <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ungere</span></em>, ‘to anoint,’
  because the maidens when they reached the threshold
  <span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>of their future husbands, were similarly accustomed
  to anoint the door-posts.” In support of this fanciful
  etymology, old-time commentators on Terence and
  Virgil are cited;<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> which shows, at least, that this ceremony
  at the threshold of the husband’s home has
  long been recognized as of vital importance in the
  marriage contract and relation.

<p class='c000'>
  It is customary, among the Greeks in Turkey, for
  the mother of the bridegroom, as he leaves his home
  to go for his bride on the morning of his wedding, to
  lay across his pathway a girdle, over which he steps,
  and to pour a libation of water before him.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a>

  In the Morea, in the vicinity of Sparta, it is said
  that, when the bride is brought to her new home,
  the mother of the bridegroom “stands waiting at the
  door, holding a glass of honey and water in her hand.
  From this glass the bride must drink; ... while the
  lintel of the door is smeared with the remainder; ...
  in the meantime one of the company breaks a pomegranate
  on the threshold.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> In Rhodes, when the
  newly married couple enter the doorway of their new
  home, the husband “dips his finger in a cup of honey,
  and traces a cross over the door.... A pomegranate
  <span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>is placed on the threshold, which the young husband
  crushes with his foot as he enters, followed by his
  wife, over whom the wedding guests throw corn and
  cotton seeds and orange flower water.”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  On Skarpanto (Carpathos), an island lying between
  Rhodes and Crete, when the bridegroom reaches the
  door of the bride’s house “he is greeted by the
  mother of the bride, who touches the nape of his
  neck with a censer containing incense.... She further
  gives him a present called <em>embatikon</em>,–that is to say,
  ‘the gift of in-going,’–and then places on the threshold
  a rug or blanket folded, with a stick resting on
  one of the corners. The bridegroom advances his
  right foot, breaks the stick and passes in.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a>

  Among the Morlacchi, in Dalmatia, it is, or was, a
  custom for a bride to kneel and kiss the threshold of
  her husband’s home, before crossing it for the first
  time. Her mother-in-law, or some other near relative
  of her husband, at the same time presented her with a
  sieve full of different kinds of grain, nuts, and small
  fruits, which the bride scattered behind her back as
  she passed in.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>

  It is a custom in portions of Russia, when the bride
  is about to leave her father’s home to meet the bridegroom,
  <span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>for the friends of the bridegroom to appear at
  the door, and request that the bride be brought to
  them. “After their request has been many times
  repeated, the ‘princess’ [as the bride is called] appears,
  attended by her relatives and attendants, but
  stops short at the door. Again the bridegroom’s
  friends demand the bride, but are told first to ‘cleanse
  the threshold; then will the young princess cross
  the threshold.’” Thereupon gifts are made by the
  bridegroom’s friend, and the bride crosses the threshold
  to go to the bridegroom.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Mordvins (or, Mordevins), a Finnish
  people on the Volga, there are various customs in
  connection with marriage, tending to confirm the idea
  that the threshold is the household altar. In a ceremony
  of betrothal, with a conference over the terms
  of dowry, a prayer is offered to the “goddess of the
  homestead,” and the “goddess of the dwelling-house;”
  “the girl’s father then cuts off the corner of a loaf of
  bread with three slashes of a knife, salts it, and places
  it under the threshold, where the Penates are believed
  to frequent. This is called the ‘gods’ portion.’” Bread
  and salt are factors in a sacred covenant, and their
  proffer to the household gods, at the threshold altar,
  would seem to be an invitation to those gods to be a
  party to the new marriage covenant. Again, after the
  <span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>terms of betrothal are agreed on, there is the feast of
  “hand-striking,” or ratification of the betrothal. On
  that occasion also the “gods’ portion” is offered; and
  “a little brandy is spilt under the threshold. Bread
  and salt are once more placed under the threshold by
  the bride’s father, who carries it from the table to the
  household altar “on the point of the knife–under no
  circumstances in his hands.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a>

  A custom of strewing the threshold of the home

  On the evening before the marriage ceremony, in
  the rural districts and smaller towns of Northern
  Germany, the boys and girls, and others in the neighborhood,
  are accustomed to appear at the door of the
  bride’s house, and smash on the threshold earthen pots
  and jars, with loud cries of joy. “Sometimes, whole
  car-loads of broken pottery have to be removed from
  the door the next morning.” And when the young
  couple return to their home, after the ceremony at
  the church, poor boys and girls are accustomed to
  stretch a colored cord across the door of the house, to
  prevent a passage over the threshold, unless the bridegroom
  <span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>throws a handful of small coins among those
  who bar the way.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a>

  <span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>seemed to consist in the reaching across the

  Among the Towkas, in the same part of the world,
  a bridegroom would go with his friends to the home
  of his bride, carrying a bundle of gifts for her. Sitting
  down outside of the door, he would call on her
  family to open to him. There being no response,
  music would then be tried by his friends. At this the
  door would be opened just far enough for him to put
  a gift inside over the threshold. One by one his gifts
  would be passed in, in this way, while the door opened
  wider and wider. When the last gift was over the
  threshold, the lover would spring within, and, seizing
  the bride, would carry her across the threshold, and
  take her to a temporary hut erected within a charmed
  circle near by, while his friends guarded him from
  intrusion.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a>

  And thus, in various ways, among widely different
  primitive peoples, the marriage customs go to show
  that the home threshold cannot be passed except by
  overcoming a barrier of some kind, and making an
  offering, bloody or bloodless, at this primal family
  altar. An essential part of the covenant of union is a
  halting at, and then passing over, the threshold of the
  new home, with an accompanying sacrifice.

<p class='c011'>
  Even more widespread and prominent than the
  custom of offering blood, or of making a libation, or
  of overcoming a special barrier, at the threshold, or
  of anointing or stamping the posts or lintel of the
  doorway as a sign of the covenant, at the time of a
  marriage, and as a part of the ceremony, is the habit
  of causing the bride to cross the threshold with care,
  without stepping upon it. This custom is of well-nigh
  world-wide observance, and it has attracted the
  attention of anthropologists and students of primitive
  customs. A favorite method of explaining it has
  been by calling it a survival of the practice of “marriage
  by capture;” but this is nothing more than an
  unscientific guess, in defiance of the truth that persistent
  popular customs have their origin in a sentiment,
  and not in a passing historic practice. The
  earliest mentions of this custom, of the bride’s crossing
  the threshold without stepping on it, show it as a
  voluntary religious rite; and there are traces of its
  recognition in this light from the earliest times until
  now.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the Vedic Sutras, or the sacrificial rules of the
  ancient Hindoo literature, it is specifically declared
  that a bride, on entering her husband’s home, shall
  <span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>step across the threshold, and not upon it. She is
  not lifted over the door-sill, but she voluntarily crosses
  it. Thus it is said: “When (the bridegroom with his
  bride) has come to his house, he says to her, ‘Cross
  (the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand
  on the threshold.’”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> In this ancient ceremony, grains
  of rice are poured on the heads of the bridegroom
  and his bride.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> This modern custom has, therefore, a
  very early origin. And again: “He makes her enter
  the house (which she does) with her right foot. And
  she does not stand on the threshold.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Putting the right foot forward seems to be a matter
  of importance in various primitive religions. “Put
  your right foot first” is a maxim ascribed to Pythagoras.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
  In his description of the proportions of a temple,
  the Roman architect Vitruvius said: “The number
  of steps in front should always be odd, since, in that
  case, the right foot, which begins the ascent, will be
  that which first alights on the landing of the temple.”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a>
  A Muhammadan is always careful to put his right
  foot first in crossing over the threshold of a mosk.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Albanians, when the bride is taken to
  <span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>the home of the bridegroom, accompanied by the
  <em>vlam</em>, or “the friend of the bridegroom,” it is said that
  “particular care is taken that the threshold should be
  crossed with the right foot foremost.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Here, as in
  India, the crossing of the threshold is a voluntary act.
  The bride is not lifted over, but crosses of her own
  accord. If she be veiled, the lifting is a necessity.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In Madagascar, “on entering a house, especially a
  royal house, it is improper to use the left foot on first
  stepping into it. One must ‘put one’s best (or right)
  foot foremost.’”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The bride, in Upper Syria, is sometimes carried
  across the threshold of the bridegroom’s house by
  friends of the bridegroom.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> She, of course, is veiled.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When the bride reaches the outer gate of her husband’s
  residence, in Egypt, the bridegroom meets her,
  enveloped as she is in her cashmere shawl, clasps her
  in his arms, and carries her across the threshold, and
  up to the doorway of the female apartments.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  In portions of Abyssinia, the bridegroom carries his
  bride from her home to his, bearing her across the
  threshold as he enters his house.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>So, also, it is among the more primitive tribes in
  West Africa. The bride is carried over the threshold
  in a rude chair, or on the shoulders of her friends,
  into her new home.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There are traces of a similar custom in the marriage
  ceremonies of ancient Assyria.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Again, it is said to be found among the Khonds of
  Orissa,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a> the Tatars,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> and the Eskimos.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  In ancient Greece<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a> and in ancient Rome<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a> the lifting
  of the bride over the threshold of her new home was
  an important part of the marriage ceremony. Classic
  writers had their explanations of this custom, as certain
  modern anthropologists have theirs, but the origin
  of the ceremony was earlier than they imagined.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In unchanging China the use of fire on the threshold
  altar, in connection with the marriage ceremony, is
  continued to the present day. The bride is borne in
  a sedan-chair to the house of the bridegroom, accompanied
  <span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>by a procession of friends and musicians.
  “On arriving at the portal of the house, the bridegroom
  taps the door of the sedan-chair with his
  fan, and in response, the instructress of matrimony,
  who prompts every act of the bride, opens the door
  and hands out the still enshrouded young lady, who
  is carried bodily over a pan of lighted charcoal, or a
  red-hot coulter laid on the threshold, while at the
  same moment a servant offers for her acceptance some
  rice and preserved prunes.”<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Again, it is burning straw that is thrown upon the
  door-sill, and is half extinguished before the Chinese
  bride is led to step across it. The instructress says at
  this point:
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Fire, like blood, stands for life in the primitive
  mind; and fire, like blood, has its place on the altar.
  Indeed, as the first threshold altar was the hearthstone,
  it was the place of the household fire. The
  sacredness of the domestic fire is recognized in
  all the Hindoo religious literature; and a Hindoo
  couple, on beginning their married life, must have a
  <span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>care to enter a new home bringing their sacred altar
  fire with them.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> In ancient Greece, the mother of
  the bride accompanied her daughter to the threshold
  of her new home, bearing a flaming torch “kindled
  at the parental hearth, according to custom immemorial.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
  A torch was similarly borne in the Roman
  marriage ceremonies.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> This custom is referred to in
  the term “hymen’s torch,” or the “nuptial torch.”
  “In Cicero’s time, they did not distinguish the hearth-fire
  from the Penates, nor the Penates from the Lares.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
  The bride, in India, in China, in Greece, and in Rome,
  worshiped at the altar-fire of her new home.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A connecting link between the altar fire and the nuptial
  torch is found in a marriage custom of the Erza,
  of the Mordvins, in Russia. On the eve of the wedding
  day the bridegroom’s family make ready for the
  bride. “A thick candle, and several thinner ones,
  have ... been made ready for the occasion. The
  bridegroom’s father lights the smaller ones before the
  holy pictures [in use in families of the Greek Church],
  but sets up the large one on the threshold. It is
  <span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>called ‘the house candle.’” The father then prays
  for the new couple.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A survival of an ancient Slavic custom, of covenanting
  together by crossing together an altar fire, would
  also seem to exist in Russia in the practices of young
  people at the “Midsummer Day” festival. A Russian
  writer says of these festivals: “More than once
  have I had an opportunity of being present at these
  nightly meetings, held at the end of June, in commemoration
  of a heathen divinity. They usually take
  place close to a river or pond; large fires are lighted,
  and over them young couples, bachelors and unmarried
  girls, jump barefoot.”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There is a custom of wooing among the Moksha,
  of the Mordvins, that brings the threshold-altar idea
  into prominence. The parents of the wooer first make
  gifts, at their home, to the household goddesses.
  “These gifts consist of dough figures of domestic
  animals, which are placed under the threshold of the
  house and of the outside gate, while prayer is made to
  the goddesses and to deceased ancestors. The father
  [of the bridegroom] then cuts off a corner of a loaf
  placed on the table, and at the time of the offering
  <span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>scoops out the inside and fills it with honey. At midnight
  he drives in profound secrecy to the house of
  the bride elect, places the honeyed bread on the gate-post
  [of her house], strikes the window with his whip,
  and shouts: ‘<em>Seta!</em> I, <em>Veshnak Mazakoff</em>, make a
  match between thy daughter and my son <em>Uru</em>. Take
  the honeyed bread from thy gate-post, and pray.’”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
  The images of domestic animals would here seem to
  stand for the slaughtered animals formerly offered at
  the threshold altar; and the linking of the altars of
  the two homes by offerings and prayer would seem to
  indicate the desire for a sacred covenant. When the
  bride is received at the bridegroom’s house, a notch is
  cut “with an ax in the door-post to mark the arrival
  of a new addition to the family.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Erza, of the same province, the bride, on
  the day of “the girl’s feast,” preceding her marriage,
  “takes mould [earth] from under the threshold [of
  her parental home] with her finger-tips, and thrusts it
  into her bosom,” as she goes out to seek a farewell
  blessing from her friends. In the bridegroom’s home,
  meanwhile, a lighted candle is placed on the threshold
  of the door; and, in some regions, when he and his
  friends go to the bride’s house to bring her to his
  home, he and they are met at the door by her parents
  <span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>with the covenanting bread and salt, and the words,
  “Be welcome, come within.” As the bride is borne
  out of her old home to go to her new one, she and
  her party “all halt and bow to the gate, for there, or
  in the courtyard, is the abode of the god that protects
  the dwelling-place. The following prayer is
  made to him: ‘<em>Kardas Sarks</em>, the nourisher, god of
  the house, do not abandon her that is about to depart;
  always be near her just as thou art here.‘” When
  she reaches her new home, she is carried (over the
  threshold), in the arms of some of her party, into the
  house of the bridegroom, carrying a lighted candle.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The custom survived in portions of Scotland, as
  recently as the beginning of this century, of lifting a
  bride over the threshold, or the first step of the door.
  A cake of bread, prepared for the occasion, was, at
  the same time, broken by the bridegroom’s mother
  over the head of the bride. The bride was then led
  directly to the hearth, and the poker and tongs, and
  sometimes the broom, were put into her hands “as
  symbols of her office and duty.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Lifting the bride over the threshold has been practiced
  in recent times, in England, Ireland, and the
  United States.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>Both bride and bridegroom were carried, on the
  shoulders of their elders, across the threshold of their
  new home, and laid on their bridal bed, in the marriage
  ceremonies of some of the tribes of Central
  America. And again the bridegroom carried his
  bride in this way.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a> In either case, it was the crossing
  of the threshold without stepping on it that was
  the thing aimed at.

<h3 class='c010'>5.  LAYING FOUNDATIONS IN BLOOD.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  In the building of a house, as a new home, the
  prominence given to the laying of the threshold, or to
  its dedicating by blood, is another indication, or outcome,
  of its altar-like sacredness. In Upper Syria a
  sacrifice is often made at the beginning of the building
  of a new house, and again at the first crossing of
  its threshold. “When a new house is built,” among
  the Metâwileh, “the owner will not reside in it until,
  with certain formalities, a black hen has been carried
  several times round the house and slaughtered within
  the door,” as if in covenant dedication of the house.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Copts in Egypt, when the threshold of
  a new house is laid, the owner slaughters a sheep or
  a goat on the threshold, and steps over the blood,
  <span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>as if in covenant for himself and his household with
  Him to whom all blood, as life, belongs. Then he
  divides the sacrificed victim among his neighbors;
  and they in turn come and step across the blood on
  the threshold, invoking as they do so a blessing on
  the new house and its owner, while coming into covenant
  with him.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The foundation-stone of a new building is, in a
  sense, the threshold of that structure. Hence to lay
  the foundations in blood is to proffer blood at the
  threshold. Traces of this custom are to be found in
  the practices or the legends of peoples wellnigh all
  the world over.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Apparently the earlier sacrifices were
  of human beings.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a> Later they were of animals substituted
  for persons. The idea seems to have been
  that he who covenanted by blood with God, or with
  the gods, when his house, or his city, was builded,
  was guarded, together with his household, while he
  and they were dwellers there; but, if he failed to
  proffer a threshold sacrifice, his first-born, or the first
  person who crossed the bloodless threshold, would be
  claimed by the ignored or defied deity.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There is, indeed, a suggestion of this idea in the
  <span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>curse pronounced by Joshua, when he destroyed the
  doomed city of Jericho, against him who should rebuild
  its walls, he not being in covenant with and
  obedient to the Lord. “Cursed be the man before
  the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho:
  with the loss of his firstborn shall he lay the foundation
  thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son
  shall he set up the gates of it.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a> A later record tells
  of the fulfilment of this curse. It says of the reign of
  Ahab: “In his days did Hiel the Bethel-ite build
  Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss
  of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof
  with the loss of his youngest son Segub; according to
  the word of the Lord, which he spake by the hand of
  Joshua the son of Nun.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Human sacrifices, in order to furnish blood at the
  foundations of a house, or of a public structure, have
  been continued down to recent times, or to the present,
  in some portions of the world; and there are indications
  in popular tradition that they were frequent
  in a not remote past.

  It is said that at the building of Scutari, in Asia
  Minor, “the workmen were engaged on its fortifications
  for three years, but the walls would not stand.
  Then they protested that the only possible way to succeed
  was to lay under or in them a living human
  <span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>being. They accordingly laid hold of a young woman
  who brought them dinner, and immured her.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a>

  According to a story in China, when the bridge
  leading to the site of St. John’s College, in Shanghai,
  was in process of building, an official present took off
  his shoes, as indicating his rank, and threw them into
  the stream, in order to stay the current, and enable
  the workmen to lay the foundations. Finding this
  unavailing, he took off his garments and threw them
  in. Finally he threw himself in, and as his life went
  out the workmen were enabled to go on with their
  building. To this day the belief is general that that
  structure stands fast because of this sacrifice.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a>

  Until the transfer of Alaska to the United States, in
  1867, by the Russian government, human sacrifices at
  <span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>the foundation of a new house were common in that
  portion of America. The ceremonies are thus described
  by one familiar with them: “The rectangular
  space for the building is ... cleared, a spot for the
  fireplace designated, and four holes dug, wherein the
  corner posts are to be set.... A slave, either man or
  woman who has been captured in war or is even a
  descendant of such a slave, is blindfolded and compelled
  to lie down face uppermost, in the place selected
  for the fireplace [the site of the domestic altar]. A
  sapling is then cut, laid across the throat of the slave,
  and, at a given signal, the two nearest relatives of the
  host sit upon the respective ends of the sapling, thereby
  choking the unhappy wretch to death. But the
  corner posts must receive their baptism; so four slaves
  are blindfolded, and one is forced to stand in each
  post-hole, when, at a given signal, a blow on the forehead
  is dealt with a peculiar club ornamented with
  the host’s coat of arms.” It is said that even to the
  present time, on the building of a house in Alaska,
  “the same ceremonies are enacted, with the exception
  of the sacrifices, which are prevented by the United

  are several versions, of the building of the bridge
  of Arta, it is told how the bridge fell down as fast
  as it was built, until at last the master-builder
  dreamed a dream that it would only stand if his own
  wife were buried alive in the foundations. He therefore
  sends for her, bidding her dress in festival attire,
  and then finds an excuse to make her descend into
  the central pile, whereupon they heap the earth over
  her, and thus the bridge stands fast.”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a>

  Various substitutes for human offerings at the laying
  of a foundation-stone, or a threshold, have been
  adopted in different countries. Thus, in modern
  Greece, “after the ground has been cleared for the
  foundations of a new house, the future owner, his
  family, and the workmen attend, together with the
  <em>pappas</em> [the priest] in full canonicals, accompanied
  by incense, holy water, and all due accessories. A
  prayer is said, and those present are aspersed, and
  the site is sprinkled with the consecrated water.
  Then a fowl or a lamb, which you have noticed lying
  near with the feet tied together, is taken by one of the
  workmen, killed and decapitated, the <em>pappas</em> standing
  by all the while, and even giving directions; the
  blood is then smeared on the foundation-stone, in the
  fulfilment of the popular adage that ‘there must be
  blood in the foundation.’”<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a>

  Among the Russian peasants the idea prevails that
  the building of a new house “is apt to be followed by
  the death of the head of the family for which the new
  dwelling is constructed, or that the member of the
  family who is the first to enter it will soon die. In
  accordance with a custom of great antiquity, the oldest
  member of a migrating household enters the new
  house first; and in many places, as, for instance, in
  the Government of Archangel, some animal is killed
  and buried on the spot on which the first log or stone
  is laid.”<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a>

  The “upper corner” of a house, in Russia, is peculiarly
  sacred, having even more honor than the doorway
  threshold in the ordinary home. Yet this upper
  corner seems to be in a sense the real threshold, or
  foundation corner, of the building. A cock is the
  ordinary victim sacrificed “on the spot which a projected
  house is to cover.” The head of this cock is
  buried “exactly where the ‘upper corner’ of the
  <span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>building is to stand.” And this corner is thenceforward
  a sacred corner. Opposite to it is the stove.
  It is called the “great” and the “beautiful” corner.
  The family meal is eaten before it, and every one who
  enters the cottage makes obeisance toward it. Formerly
  ancestral images are supposed to have been in
  that corner, and now holy pictures are there.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a> It
  would seem to be in accordance with this idea that
  the foundation-stone, or threshold, of a new building,
  which in civilized lands is now laid with imposing
  ceremonies, is known as the “corner-stone.” Yet the
  “corner-stone” of a modern building is sometimes at
  the corner of the central doorway.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It is worthy of note that in ancient Egypt the one
  door of an ordinary dwelling-house was placed at one
  side, or end, of the front wall, and not in the center;
  so that the corner-stone of the building was literally a
  portion of the threshold.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a> The same was true of many
  an old-time New England house; the “front door”
  was at the left-hand side (as one approached the house)
  of the gable end. Thus the threshold of the door was
  often the corner-stone.

<h3 class='c010'>6. APPEALS AT THE ALTAR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  Because the threshold is recognized as an altar,
  nearness to the altar is nearness to God, or to the
  gods worshiped at that altar. Hence appeals are made
  and justice is sought at the gate, or at the threshold,
  as in the presence of deity.

  To present one’s self at the tent doorway, or to lay

  One of the fundamental laws of the Afghans makes
  it incumbent on a host to “shelter and protect any
  one who in extremity may flee to his threshold, and
  seek an asylum under his roof.” Property or life
  must be sacrificed in his behalf, if need be. “As soon
  as you have crossed the threshold of an Afghan you
  are sacred to him, though you were his deadly foe,
  and he will give up his own life to save yours.” A
  favorite poem of the Afghan, entitled, “Adam Khan
  and Durkhani,” tells of a son who killed his father
  because that father had betrayed a refugee who sought
  the sanctuary of his threshold. And all Afghans
  honor the memory of that son.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a>

  Among the Arabs of the Syrian desert, when a
  man would leave his own tribe and join himself to
  <span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>another, he takes a lamb or a goat with him, and
  presents himself at the entrance of the tent of the
  shaykh of the tribe he would find a home in. Slaying
  the animal there, and allowing its blood to run out on
  the ground at the threshold of the tent, he makes his
  appeal to the shaykh to accept him as a member of
  his tribe, or as a son by adoption. And this appeal
  has peculiar force, as a voice by blood.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When a man among these tribes is in peril of his
  life, pursued by an enemy, he can similarly make an
  appeal for sanctuary at the threshold altar of a shaykh’s
  tent, with a like outpouring of the blood of an animal
  brought by him; and protection must be granted him
  by the shaykh. It is as though he had laid hold of
  the “horns of the altar.” So, again, when a man
  would be reconciled with an enemy who has cause for
  bitter hostility, he goes to the tent of that enemy
  and sacrifices an animal at the threshold, with an
  appeal for forgiveness. This offering of a threshold
  sacrifice secures his safety.

  In other portions of Arabia this same idea finds a

  <span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>his head several times with the sharp blades. Then
  drawing his hands over his bloody scalp, he wipes
  them on the door-post. The other must then come
  out and cover the suppliant’s head with a shawl
  [covering the offense, in covering the offender], after
  which he kills a sheep, and they sit down together at

  In accordance with this primitive idea, it became a
  custom in India for one who would obtain justice from
  another to seat himself at the door of a house, or a tent,
  and refuse to move from that position until he starved
  to death, unless his claim were heeded. If the suitor
  died at the door, or the household altar, the sin of
  his death rested upon the householder. The suitor’s
  blood cried out against the evil-doer.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Even to the present time appeals at the household
  altar are made in blood, in portions of India. A case
  recently before the British court in Kathiawar involved
  an illustration of such an appeal. One of the
  Charaus, a caste of heralds, had become responsible
  with his life, according to custom, for the repayment
  of a loan made to a land owner. The land owner
  delayed payment, and seemed disposed to avoid it.
  “The herald and his brother, with their old mother
  for a sacrifice, went to the door of the debtor’s house
  and demanded payment, as their family honor was at
  stake. When the land owner would not pay, the herald
  struck off the head of his mother with his sword
  before the door, the brother at the same time wounded
  (intending to kill) the debtor, and the two brothers
  sprinkled the mingled blood of the sacrifice on the
  <span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>householder’s door-posts. The land owner, smitten
  by public infamy and the guilt of the matricide, starved
  himself to death.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> References to this responsibility

  Even where the primitive custom of sacrificing at
  the doorway has died out, there sometimes seems to
  be a survival of it in popular phraseology. Talcott
  Williams, of Philadelphia, relates an incident of his
  experiences in Morocco, which illustrates this. He
  says: “As I was riding through the Soko at Tangier
  on a morning in June, 1889, a servant stopped me,
  and said: ‘Four men, from near Azila (a town on
  the seacoast of Morocco, about thirty miles away),
  are waiting for you at the gate of the house of Mr.
  Perdicarus, and they have killed a sheep.’ ‘What
  have they killed a sheep for?’ said I. ‘Oh!’ said
  the servant, ‘I don’t mean that they have actually
  killed a sheep, but they are sitting at the gate, asking
  for your help, and expect you to aid them in their
  trouble, because they have heard that you have influence
  with the American consul, and are a man of
  importance in your own country, and we call that
  “killing a sheep.”’ I think he added ‘at the gate,’
  but my memory is not perfectly clear at this point. I
  rode on to the house of my friend, where I was stopping,
  <span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>and found there the kinsman of a sheikh, who
  had been imprisoned by the American consul. They
  seized my horse’s bridle, and, with the usual Oriental
  signs of respect, refused to let me dismount until I
  had heard them and their plea for help.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “I was told by my own servant and the other Orientals
  there, that this plea ‘at the gate,’ accompanied
  as it was by the readiness to ‘kill a sheep,’ was one
  which no man in Morocco would dream of disregarding.
  I made some inquiry on the subject afterwards,
  and found that the habit of sitting at the gate waiting
  for a man of supposed influence or authority, while
  absent, to return to his house, often actually accompanied,
  though less frequently at present, by the
  slaughter of a sheep, whose blood is poured across
  the road over which he must pass, was a form used
  only in cases of dire necessity, and one to which a
  man with whom other pleas would avail nothing, felt
  compelled to give attention. I am glad to add that
  in my own case this ancient rite was not without its
  fruits to those who had used it.”<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a>

<h3 class='c010'>7. COVENANT TOKENS ON THE DOORWAY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  Because the threshold of the doorway is the primitive
  altar of the household, the doorway itself is, as it
  were, a framework above the altar; and the side-posts
  and lintel of the doorway fittingly bear tokens or inscriptions
  in testimony to the sacredness of the passage
  into the home sanctuary. It would seem that
  originally the blood poured out in sacrifice on the
  threshold was made use of for marking the door-posts
  and lintel with proofs of the covenant entered into between
  the in-comer and the host; and that afterwards
  other symbols of life, and appropriate inscriptions,
  were substituted for the blood itself.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There are survivals in the East, at the present time,
  of the original method of blood-marking the frame of
  the doorway; and there are traces of its practice in
  ancient times in both the East and the West. President
  Washburn, of Robert College, Constantinople,
  says:<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> “I remember, after the great fire in Stamboul,
  in 1865, going over the ruins, and coming to a house
  that the fire had spared; a sheep had been sacrificed
  <span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>on the threshold, and a hand dipped in the blood and
  struck upon the two door-posts.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  This appears, also, in the installing of a Chief
  Rabbi in modern Jerusalem. In the welcome to
  the Hakham Bâshi, or the “First in Zion,”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> “the
  multitude of those gathered together accompany him
  to his house, but before he sets the sole of his foot
  upon the threshold of the outer gate [or court] one
  of the shokheteem [or official slaughterers] slays a
  perfect beast, and pronounces the sacrificial blessing,
  and all those present answer, Amen. Then the rabbi,
  the Hakham Bâshi, steps over the beast which has
  been slain, and the shokhet dips the two palms of his
  hands into the blood, and marks first the vessels of the
  rabbi’s house. And, with his hands stained with
  blood, he forms the semblance of a hand above the
  lintel of the door;–in their trust that this thing is
  good [the proper thing] for the evil eye;–and the
  flesh of the beast they distribute to the poor.”<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A custom in this same line is noted among the Jews
  in Morocco, in connection with wedding observances.
  “Whilst the bullock, or other animal, is being slaughtered
  for the evening’s festivities, a number of boys
  dip their hands in the blood, and make an impression
  of an outspread hand on the door-posts and walls of
  <span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>the bride’s house;” supposedly “for the purpose of
  keeping off the ‘evil eye,’ and thus ensuring good luck
  to the newly married couple.”<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There are indications of such a custom in ancient
  times. Layard says of his researches in Assyria:
  “On all the slabs forming entrances in the oldest
  palaces of Nimroud, were marks of a black fluid
  resembling blood, which appeared to be daubed on
  the stone. I have not been able to ascertain the
  nature of this fluid; but its appearance cannot fail to
  call to mind the Jewish ceremony of placing the
  blood of the sacrifice on the lintel of the doorway.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In ancient Egypt there were inscriptions, together
  with the name of the owner, on the side-posts and
  lintels of the dwellings. “Besides the owner’s name,”
  says Wilkinson,<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a> “they sometimes wrote a lucky sentence
  over the entrance of the house, for a favorable
  omen, as ‘The Good Abode,’ the <em>múnzel mobárak</em> of
  the modern Arabs, or something similar; and the
  lintels and imposts of the doors in the royal mansions
  were frequently covered with hieroglyphics, containing
  the ovals and titles of the monarch. It was, perhaps,
  at the dedication of the house, that these sentences
  were affixed; and we may infer, from the early mention
  <span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>of this custom among the Jews, that it was derived
  from Egypt.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When it is understood that the inscribing, on the
  doorways, of dedications to protecting deities, was
  common among primitive peoples, it would seem to
  be in accordance with that custom that the Hebrews
  were commanded to dedicate their doorways to the
  one living God. It is said of the words of the covenant
  of God with his people, as recorded in Deuteronomy
  6 : 4–9 and 11 : 13–21, “Thou shalt write them
  upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy
  gates.” To this day, among stricter Jews, these
  covenant words inscribed on parchment, and enclosed
  in a cylinder of glass, or a case of metal or of wood,
  are affixed to the side-posts of every principal door in
  the house. This case and inscription are called the
  “mezuza.” On the outside of the written scroll, the
  divine name, <em>Shaddai</em>,–“the Almighty,”–is so inscribed
  that it may be in sight through an opening in
  the case or cylinder. This name stands for “the
  Guardian of the dwellings of Israel,” whose protection
  is thus invoked above the primitive altar of the household
  on the threshold of the entrance way.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “Every pious Jew, as often as he passes the mezuza,
  touches the divine name with the finger of his right
  <span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>hand, puts it to his mouth and kisses it, saying in
  Hebrew, ‘The Lord shall preserve thy going out and
  thy coming in, from this time forth, and for evermore;’<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
  and when leaving on a business expedition he says,
  after touching it, ‘In thy name, <em>kuzu bemuchsaz kuzu</em>
  (=God), I go out and shall prosper.’”<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a> In some
  cases the covenant words are inscribed directly upon
  the door-posts, instead of being written on parchment
  and enclosed in a case.

<p class='c000'>
  On the lintels of the ancient synagogues in Palestine
  there were sculptured symbolic figures, such as
  the paschal lamb, a pot of manna, a vine, or a bunch
  of grapes, together with inscriptions; and the door-posts
  were ornamented more or less richly.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Evidences
  of this are still abundant.

  Speaking of the writing over the door and all
  round the room at the office of the consul in Sidon,
  Dr. Thomson says that Muhammadans “never set up
  a gate, cover a fountain, build a bridge, or erect a

  the Koran, or from their best poets. Christians also
  do the same.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a> These writings are deemed a protection

  <span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>of the sacrifice of a fowl in honor of the divinity called

  altar was erected at the bow of the vessel, as its beginning,

  fastened to the door-posts and lintels of the cabin.”<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a>

  The Greeks certainly recognized the entrance of the

  “Before each house stood, usually, its own peculiar

  door, “for good luck,” or as a talisman, “an inscription
  was often placed.”<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a> And on occasions, as when

  In Central America and in South America the blood

<h3 class='c010'>8.  SYMBOL OF THE RED HAND.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  It would seem that, in primitive practice, the hand
  of the covenanter dipped in the sacrificial blood on
  the threshold, and stamped on the door-posts and
  lintel, was the sign-manual of the covenant between
  the contracting party or parties, and God, or the gods,
  invoked in the sacrifice. Illustrations of this custom,
  as still surviving in the East, have been given, from
  Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Morocco.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c012'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Naturally,
  therefore, the sign-manual by itself came to stand for,
  <span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>or to symbolize, the covenant of the threshold altar;
  and the stamp of the red hand became a token of trust
  in God or the gods covenanted with in sacrifice, and
  of power or might resulting from this covenant relation.
  Wherever the red hand was shown, or found,
  it was a symbol of covenant favor with Deity, and it
  came to be known, accordingly, as the “hand of
  might.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the region of ancient Babylonia, also, the red-hand
  stamp is still to be seen on houses and on animals,
  apparently as the symbol of their covenant consecration
  by their owner. Dr. Hilprecht says: “Over all
  the doors of the rooms in the large khan of Hillah,
  on the Euphrates, partly built upon the ruins of ancient
  Babylon, I noticed the red impression of an outspread
  hand, when I was there in January, 1889. Several
  white horses in our caravan from Bagdâd to Nippur
  had the stamp of a red hand on their haunches.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  This symbol is much used in Jerusalem. Referring
  to its frequency, Major Conder says: “The ‘hand of
  might’ is another Jewish belief which may be supposed
  to have an Aryan origin. This hand is drawn
  on the lintel or above the arch of the door. Sometimes
  it is carved in relief, and before one house in
  the Jews’ quarter, in Jerusalem, there is an elaborate
  specimen, carefully sculptured and colored with
  vermilion. Small glass charms, in the form of the
  <span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>hand, are also worn, and the symbol is supposed to
  bring good luck. The Jewish and Arab masons paint
  the same mark on houses in course of construction;
  and, next to the seven-branched candlestick, it is
  probably the commonest house-mark in Jerusalem.”<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c012'><sup>[211]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A Jerusalem Jew thus tells of its use among a portion
  of his co-religionists in that city: “Our brethren
  the Sephardeem [the Spanish Jews], like all the remnant
  of the sons of the East, consider the semblance
  of a hand as good against the power of the evil eye in
  a man. And they draw this shape upon the doors of
  their houses with a red finger. So, too, they place upon
  the heads of their children a hand wrought in silver,
  saying that this hand–or this picture of the five fingers–is
  noxious to the man who delights to bring the evil
  upon the child, or upon those dwelling in the house.
  So, again, when men quarrel, the one sets his five fingers
  before the other’s evil eye, saying that this sign
  neutralizes the evil.”<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c012'><sup>[212]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  This sign of the hand is “found on the houses of
  Jews, Muslims, and Christians, in various parts of
  Palestine.” It is generally painted on or above the
  door, often in blue; but frequently, especially when a
  Jew or a Muhammadan enters a new house, a lamb is
  sacrificed at the door, and the stamp of the hand in
  <span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>the fresh blood is affixed to the post or to the walls.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c012'><sup>[213]</sup></a>
  No one claims to know the origin of this symbol, but
  all recognize its importance.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In its ruder form the figure of the hand is much
  like a five-branched candlestick. Indeed, it has sometimes
  been mistaken for that symbol. This was the
  case when such a figure was noticed, not long ago,
  by Dr. Noetling, on Jewish houses in Safed, and reported
  to a European journal. This symbol is sometimes
  called the “Hand of Moses.” A similar figure
  on Muslim houses is said to represent the “Hand of
  the Prophet;” while in Syria, among Christians, it is
  called the <em>Kef Miryam</em>, the “Virgin Mary’s Hand.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c012'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
  Obviously these terms suggest the idea of power
  through divinely derived strength.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  One of the sights in the Mosk of St. Sophia, in
  Constantinople, is the stamp of a red hand. It is said
  that when Sultan Muhammad II. entered this sanctuary
  as a conqueror, he dipped his right hand in the
  blood of the slaughtered Christians, and stamped it on
  the wall, as if to seal his victory, and to pledge his
  covenant devotion to his God.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c012'><sup>[215]</sup></a> Whether this story
  be fact or legend, it is a witness to the idea of such
  a custom in the minds of Oriental peoples.

  <span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>An open hand is, or was, a common symbol on a

  Persia. At the annual festival in Persia in commemoration
  of the death of Hossein, son of Alee, two large
  banners, each surmounted with an open hand, are
  borne in front of the representation of the tomb of
  Hossein; and the same symbol appears in various
  ways during the celebration.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c012'><sup>[217]</sup></a>

  “In the East Indies, to this day, the figure of a
  hand is the emblem of power and governmental sway.
  When the Nabob of Arcot was the viceroy of five

  painted on it, and a larger banner with five hands.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c012'><sup>[218]</sup></a>

  Siva, the destroyer, in the Hindoo triad, is also

  The uplifted open hand was prominent on or above
  the doors in ancient Carthage.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c012'><sup>[219]</sup></a> And a traveler in
  Northern Africa, writing of the Jews in Tunis, near
  the site of Carthage, says: “What struck me most
  <span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>in all the houses was the impression of an open
  bleeding hand on every wall of each floor. However
  white the walls, this repulsive sign was to be seen
  everywhere. A Jewess never goes out here without
  taking with her a hand carved in coral or ivory–she
  thinks it a talisman against the ‘evil eye,’ or ‘<em>
    mal
    occhio
  </em>.’... When his children’s pictures or horses
  are praised, the Tunisian Jew extends his five fingers,
  or pronounces the number ‘five;’ he tries by this
  means to prevent the praise doing damage.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c012'><sup>[220]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  This symbol of the open hand is frequently found
  above the graves in the vicinity of Tunis. It is also

  An open hand, in stone, or metal, or enamel, or

  It is a noteworthy fact that the uplifted hand is
  prominent in the representation of the deities of
  Babylonia, Assyria, Phenicia, and Egypt, especially
  of the gods of life, or of fertility, who have covenant
  relations with men. And the same is true of the
  representations of sovereigns, in the ancient East, who
  <span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>are supposed to be in peculiar covenant relations with
  the gods.

  Thus, on the seal of Ur-Gur, the earliest ruler of
  “Ur of the Chaldees,”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c012'><sup>[222]</sup></a> the ruler and his attendants
  appear with uplifted hands before the moon-god Sin,
  who in turn is represented with his hand uplifted, as
  if he were making covenant with them.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c012'><sup>[223]</sup></a> It is the

  When a king of ancient Babylon was recognized as
  having a right to the throne, he must lift up his hand
  and clasp the hand of the image of Bel-Merodach, in
  order to show that he had “become the adopted son
  of the true ruler of the city.” This giving and taking
  of the hand was a symbol of covenanting in Babylonia.
  In this way a child was adopted into a family, and a
  husband and a wife covenanted to become one.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The god Asshur, and his worshipers, kings or

  hand uplifted. And it is the same there with other
  deities and their worshipers.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c012'><sup>[226]</sup></a> In Phenicia, and its
  colonies, the same idea has prominence.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c012'><sup>[227]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>Deities of ancient Egypt are frequently represented

  appear before them with the right hand uplifted.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c012'><sup>[228]</sup></a> As
  showing that this is not the attitude of supplication
  or of adoration, like the bowed form, the crossed arms,
  or the upturned palms, it is to be noted that in the
  representation of Amenophis IV., or Khuen-aten, with
  his family, before the aten-ra or the solar disk, the
  worshipers stand with their right hands uplifted, while

  In the county of Roscommon, in Ireland, there is
  a stone known as “a druidical altar,” which the common

<p class='c000'>
  Among the ruins in Central America, there were
  found at the doorways and on the walls of many
  of the ruined buildings of Yucatan the stamp of
  a red hand on the plaster or on the stone. “They
  were the prints of a red hand, with the thumb
  and fingers extended, not drawn or painted, but
  <span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>stamped by the living hand, the pressure of the
  palm upon the stone. He who made it had stood
  before it alive, ... and pressed his hand, moistened
  with red paint, hard against the stone. The seams
  and creases of the palm were clear and distinct in
  the impression.” As showing the idea prevalent
  among the natives of that region with reference to the
  source and meaning of these signs-manual, the Indians
  of Yucatan said that the stamp was of “the hand
  of the owner of the building,” as if he had affixed it to
  his dwelling in token of his covenant with its guardian
  deity; and, again, it was thought that “these impressions
  were placed there in a formal act of consecration
  to the gods.”<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There is a clear recognition of this idea in many
  Bible references to the lifting up of the hands unto
  God, as if in covenant relations with him. Thus,
  Abraham says to the king of Sodom, “I have lift up
  my hand unto the Lord;”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c012'><sup>[232]</sup></a> as if he would say, I have
  pledged myself to him. I have given him my hand.
  And the Psalmist says: “I will lift up my hands in
  thy name.”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c012'><sup>[233]</sup></a> God himself says, by his prophet: “I
  will lift up mine hand to the nations;”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c012'><sup>[234]</sup></a> that is, I will
  covenant with them.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c012'><sup>[235]</sup></a> And so in many another case.
  <span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>Indeed, the Assyrian word for swearing (<em>nish</em>) is
  literally “lifting up the hand;”<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c012'><sup>[236]</sup></a> and the Hebrew
  word <em>nasa</em> means to lift up the hand or to swear.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c012'><sup>[237]</sup></a>
  The uplifted hand in a judicial oath seems to be a
  survival of the same thought, that an appeal is thus
  made to God, as one’s covenant God.

<p class='c000'>
  Again, there may be a reference to the “hand of
  might” in a covenant relation, in those passages
  where God is spoken of as bringing his people out of
  Egypt by “a strong hand,” or “a mighty hand,” and
  as dealing with them afterwards in the same way.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a>

  This sign of the red hand is still a familiar one
  among the aborigines of America. It is stamped on
  robes and skins, and on Indian tents.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a> Schoolcraft
  says of it: “The figure of the human hand is used
  by the North American Indians to denote supplication
  to the Deity or Great Spirit, and it stands in the
  system of picture-writing as the symbol for strength,
  power, or mastery, thus derived [through a covenant
  relation]. In a great number of instances which I
  <span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>have met with of its being employed, both in the ceremonial
  of their dances and in their pictorial records,
  I do not recollect a single one in which this sacred
  character is not assigned to it.”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c012'><sup>[241]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A frequent use of the hand-print among the American
  Indians is as “a symbol applied to the naked
  body after its preparation and decoration for sacred
  and festive dances.” These preparations are “generally
  made in the arcanum of the medicine, or secret
  lodge, or some private place, and with all the skill of
  the priest’s, the medicine-man’s, or the juggler’s art.
  The mode of applying it in these cases is by smearing
  the hand of the operator with white or colored clay,
  and impressing it on the breast, the shoulder, or other
  part of the body. The idea is thus conveyed that a
  secret influence, a charm, a mystic power, is given to
  the dancer, arising from his sanctity, or his proficiency
  in the occult arts.” Schoolcraft, speaking of this custom,
  says: “The use of the hand is not confined to a
  single tribe or people. I have noticed it alike among
  the Dacotah, the Winnebagoes, and other Western
  tribes, as among the numerous branches of the red
  race still located east of the Mississippi River, above
  the latitude of 42°, who speak dialects of the Algonquin
  language.”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>Is there possibly any connection with this idea in
  the custom of “the laying on of hands,” as a symbol
  of imparting virtue or power to one newly in covenant
  relations with those who are God’s representatives,
  so frequently referred to in the Bible?<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a> This
  would seem to be indicated by the power imparted to
  an Egyptian king by the touch of the uplifted hand
  of the deity, as shown in the representations on the
  monuments of Egypt. It was known as “the imposition
  of the Sa,” or increased vitality.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A remarkable illustration of the use of the red-hand
  print among American Indians is given in the story
  of a famous Omaha chief, who, when dying, enjoined
  it upon his followers to carry his body to a prominent
  look-out bluff above the Missouri River, and bury him
  there, full armed, on the back of his favorite war-horse,
  who was to be buried alive, that he might watch from
  that place the passing of the whites up and down the
  river. It would seem as if he wanted to be known as
  dying in the faith of his covenant relations with the
  Great Spirit, for himself and for his people.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Because of this request, in the presence of his assembled
  tribe “he was placed astride his horse’s back,
  <span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>with his bow in his hand, and his shield and quiver
  slung; with his pipe and his medicine bag; with his
  supply of dried meat, and his tobacco pouch replenished;
  ... with his flint and steel, and his tinder, to
  light his pipe by the way. The scalps that he had
  taken ... were hung to the bridle of his horse. He
  was in full dress and equipped; and on his head
  waved ... his beautiful head-dress of the war-eagle’s
  plumes.” As he stood thus on the threshold of the
  life beyond, when the last funeral honors were performed
  by the medicine-men, “every warrior of his
  band painted the palm and fingers of his right hand
  with vermilion, which was stamped and perfectly impressed
  on the milk-white sides of his devoted horse,”–as
  if in covenant pledge of fidelity to their chief in
  the sight of the Great Spirit.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There is another phase of the red-hand symbolism
  among the American Indians, which has been noted
  by Frank H. Cushing, who is so experienced and
  careful an observer of their customs and ceremonies.
  This phase connects the symbol directly with the idea
  of life and its transmission. Mr. Cushing says:<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “By reference to the paintings (and writings, to
  some extent) of such men as Catlin and Stanley, and
  <span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>to the works of Schoolcraft, Matthews, Bourke, and
  others, you will find that the red-hand symbol was
  painted on the lodges, sometimes on the clothing and
  person, and sometimes on the shields of various of the
  hunter tribes of the plains,–as, for example, of the
  Ioways, Sauks and Foxes, Sioux, Arickarees, Cheyennes,
  Arapahos, and Comanches. Precisely what
  the significance of the symbol was, with these peoples
  and others like them, I am not able to say, save that
  in some cases it was connected with war, in others
  with treaties, and in yet others as expressive of power.
  There were yet other meanings attached to the sign;
  but neither the former significances nor these latter
  were, I take it, as definite or fixed [with the hunter
  tribes] as with the more advanced and settled tribes
  of the farther south.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “Of these tribes, the typical Pueblos and the peoples
  more or less directly influenced by them–such as the
  Jicarillas on the north and east, and the Apaches to
  the south and west<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c012'><sup>[247]</sup></a>–made frequent use of not only
  the red-hand symbol, but also of the black-hand symbol.
  I have seen both, not only in the modern but
  also in the very ancient pueblos–as those of the
  Pecos, and those of the great cliff-dweller towns in
  the Chelly and other canyons. In the Pecos ruins, to
  <span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>give a special example, I copied beautiful hand-paintings
  and prints from the rafters, as well as from the
  walls of ordinary dwelling-rooms. Sometimes these
  paintings were in red, but more often in black. They
  invariably represented the hands of women, as could
  be seen by their delicacy and smallness of outline and
  by their shapeliness. There was, I think, a reason for
  this, which the following facts will explain.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “It was my good fortune to witness, early in the
  eighties, a ceremonial celebrating the attainment to
  puberty, or womanhood, of a young girl of the Jicarilla
  Apaches. The latter people are not to be confounded
  with the Apaches proper. They are a mixed people,
  descended not only from the Apaches, but also the
  Comanches, and in large part also from the Pueblos
  of the north, the so-called Tañoans of whom the Pecos
  people were a branch. It was clear from the character
  of the masks and other paraphernalia used in the
  ceremonials I witnessed, that the latter were almost,
  if not quite, wholly derived from the pueblo, rather
  than from the wilder, ancestry of the Jicarillas who
  performed them.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The ceremonial in question was performed by four
  medicine-men, or priests, as one might call them,
  within and around a rectangular enclosure of evergreen
  boughs set in the plain near to the village. Inside of
  this enclosure, which was designed to screen from
  <span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>view the more secret operations of the priest dancers
  in question, stood a little conical skin lodge, the snow-white
  top of which appeared above the screen of evergreen,
  and within which the young girl, over whom
  these rites were being enacted, was ensconced, together
  with one or two old women of the tribe. As I
  have said before, each of the priests, on appearing
  (and this they did successively; that is, the first on
  the first day, the second on the second day, and so
  on), wore a conical mask or helmet, which entirely
  concealed, not only the face, but also the head. This
  mask was painted black or red, and upon the face of
  it appeared one of these hand symbols. Unfortunately,
  I did not see the mask as worn by the first
  priest, but, as worn by the second priest on the morning
  of the second day, it bore upon its face the symbol
  of the red hand; and as worn upon the third day,
  this symbol recurred, but, if I remember aright, was
  surrounded by an outline of another color, either black
  or yellow, whilst the hand painted on the mask as
  worn on the fourth day was black surrounded by
  white, that it might stand out more conspicuously;
  and in turn, below it, were two or more dots alternating
  with dotted circles.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “My means of communicating with these people
  were but limited, but on learning that the ceremonials
  they were performing were designed to celebrate the
  <span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>attainment to maturity, or womanhood, of a virgin, I
  had little difficulty in understanding the significance
  of the succession of these various hand symbols. I
  recognized in the ceremonial as a whole the dramatic
  epitomization, to state it briefly, of the four ages of a
  woman’s life. Thus the white hand (which I was told
  had been painted on the mask of the first day) symbolized
  her infancy and girlhood, the consummation
  of which was effected by the first day’s ceremonial performed
  by the medicine-man of the white hand.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The red hand was obviously significant of this girl’s
  attainment to young womanhood, the color in this
  case symbolizing the blood of her perfected life. I
  imagine that the black hand painted on the mask
  as worn during the third day’s ceremonial was significant
  of not only the betrothal of the girl, which
  was said to have taken place during that day of the
  ceremonial, but also of her prospective maternity; the
  change of color, in the hand, from red to black, being
  naturally a symbolic representation of the change
  from red to black in blood that has been exposed to
  the sunlight and dried, and has thus become black,
  and is no longer virgin. Likewise the hand painted
  on the mask as worn during the fourth day’s ceremonial,
  which was wholly black, doubtless represented
  the fuller life of not only a matron but a grandmother.
  From this I would infer that the signs of the red and
  <span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>black hands found in the ruined pueblos like those of
  Pecos, and on the cliffs at the mouths of caves, or in
  the houses of the cliff villages, symbolized respectively
  virginity, and maternity or betrothal.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “What would seem to indicate the correctness of
  this conclusion is the fact that, as I have mentioned
  before, there were below the signs of the black hand
  of the last day’s ceremonial of the Jicarillas dots and
  dotted circles. It is well known that these dots and
  dotted circles represent, primarily, grains of corn, male
  and female; and, secondarily, children, male and
  female. Their occurrence, then, below the painted
  black hand or symbol of maternity, would indicate
  that in this case they represented the children and
  perhaps grandchildren, male and female, of the matron
  it was hoped this young girl might become.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The hand symbol as occurring amongst the Zuñi,
  with whom, of course, I am much more familiar, has
  not only some such significances as these, but also
  many others,–the significance of a given symbol depending
  upon the ceremonial with which it is associated,
  and particularly upon the coloring which is
  given to it, the colors being as various as are the
  well-known seven sacramental colors employed to
  symbolize the seven regions of the world by the
  priesthood of these people.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “I will only add, that the hand symbol painted upon
  <span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>the walls of the estufas, or Kiva temples, or upon the
  little sacred sand mounds, which are made to symbolize
  mythic mountains of the six regions during the
  ceremonials of initiation performed once every four
  years over the new children of the pueblo, are designed
  to signify the various ritualistic precepts which are
  taught to the children according as they are held to
  pertain to one or another of these little sand mounds
  or so-called mountains of generation.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “In the case above described I was told, although I
  did not myself see it, that the symbol of the red hand
  was painted by the side of the entrance to the little
  tent in which the girl sat through the ceremonials, and
  that later the same symbol in black was added to the
  other side of the entrance to this tent. In the case
  of the Pueblos the position of the hand symbols depends,
  as, no doubt, you have already inferred, upon
  the sort of ceremonial which is being performed in
  connection with them.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “It would seem, however, that the placing of these
  symbols at the <em>entrance</em> of the cave villages would
  correspond to such usages as I have above described
  as pertaining to the Jicarilla ceremonial, and that the
  painting of them on the rafters of rooms in ancient
  pueblos had a like connection; for it must be remembered
  that in the older pueblos there were no
  doorways proper [hence no thresholds]. The rooms
  <span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>were entered by means of ladders through scuttles in
  the roof.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c012'><sup>[248]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A hand-print is a signature. A hand-print in blood
  is a pledge of life in a sacred covenant. A hand-print
  in the blood of life is symbolic of a covenant of life
  with a view to the transmission of life. When a woman
  of Korea is married, she affixes her sign manual to
  the covenanting contract by placing her hand on
  the paper and having “the outline drawn round the
  fingers and wrist with a fine brush dipped in Chinese
  <span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>ink,” or again she employs “the simpler process of
  smearing her hand with black paint, and hitting the
  document with it.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c012'><sup>[249]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Formal documents have often been signed by a
  hand stamp, or a finger stamp, in blood or in ink.
  The monks of the convent of St. Catharine at Mt.
  Sinai, for instance, show a copy of the certificate of
  protection given to them by the Prophet of Islam, the
  signature to which is an impression of Muhammad’s
  open hand. A letter to Muhammad Issoof, from the
  king of Mysore, in 1754, was sealed with the king’s seal,
  “and on the back was stamped the print of a hand, a
  form equivalent, with the Mysoreans, to an oath.”<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c012'><sup>[250]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The very term “sign manual,” employed for a veritable
  signature, may point to an origin in this custom.
  Indeed, may it not be that the large red seal attached
  to important documents, at the present time, is a survival
  of the signature and seal of the bloody hand?
</p>

<h3 class='c010'>9. DEITIES OF THE DOORWAY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  Originally the covenant sacrifice at the threshold
  was with the one God of life. But as monotheism degenerated
  into polytheism, the idea came to prevail of
  different deities in different portions of the door, or
  <span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>of different deities in different districts of country or
  in different offices of life.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Each gate of an Assyrian city was dedicated to a
  special god, and named after it,–as the gate of Bel,
  the gate of Beltis, the gate of Anu, the gate of Ishtar.
  At the entrance-way of every gate gigantic winged
  bulls with human heads stood on guard, accompanied
  by winged genii.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c012'><sup>[251]</sup></a> And the central doorway to the
  king’s palace was similarly guarded.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c012'><sup>[252]</sup></a> In every house
  a special deity was appealed to at different portions of
  the doorway; Nergal on the top of the wall and beneath
  the threshold; Ea and Merodach in the passage
  to the right and left of the gate.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c012'><sup>[253]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The idea of an offering, or of a dedication, to the
  local divinity, at the time the threshold is laid, is of
  wide acceptance. In India, “the god Vāttu, or Vāttuma
  [a son of Vishnoo], is said to recline and live in
  the threshold, changing his position every month....
  On the day when the door-frame and threshold of a
  new house or temple are fixed, the <em>Vāttuma santhe</em>
  [the tribute to Vāttuma] is offered.”<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c012'><sup>[254]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In China, “Shintu and Yuhlui are named as two
  tutelar gods to whom the guardianship of the house is
  entrusted; and either the names or grotesque representations
  <span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>of these ‘gods of the threshold’ are at the
  gate of the house, with shrines to them upon the left
  of the entrance way.”<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c012'><sup>[255]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It is said of these “Chinese gods of the threshold,”
  that “in full stature, and presumably in primeval
  strength, they flank the doors of monasteries and the
  entrances to the halls of justice. Much reduced in
  size and perched high on shelves, they face each other
  in the vestibules of the Chinese home; and in their
  most diminutive aspect they become little images,
  occasionally two-headed, which are carried about the
  person as charms, or hang from the eaves of Chinese
  houses.”<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c012'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Over the doors of almost all the houses of Japan
  are to be seen small prints of the “gigantic <em>Ni-o</em>, the
  Booddhist Gog and Magog,” who are supposed to
  guard the entrance way of the holy places.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c012'><sup>[257]</sup></a> Private
  buildings as well as public need this spiritual protection.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The inscriptions at the doorways of the houses of
  ancient Egypt showed that every building was “placed
  under the protection of a tutelary deity.” This custom
  “is retained by the modern Egyptians in the
  <span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>protecting genius said to preside over the different
  quarters of Cairo.”<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c012'><sup>[258]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Tertullian, a Christian Father who wrote before the
  close of the second century, in warning believers
  against the seducements of idolatry, emphasized the
  clustering of deities at the doors and gates in the religions
  of Greece and Rome.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c012'><sup>[259]</sup></a> He says that “among
  the Greeks ... we read of Apollo Thyræus (that is,
  of the door), and the Antelii (or, Anthelii) demons, as
  presiders over entrances;” while among the Romans
  there are other “gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess),
  called after hinges; and Forculus (Door-god)
  after doors; and Limentinus (Threshold-god)
  after the threshold; and Janus (Gate-god) himself
  after the gate.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Although a Christian might not recognize these gods
  as gods, he is told to beware lest he seem to give them
  honor by adorning his gates with lamps or wreaths.
  “Indeed, a Christian will not even dishonor his own
  gate with laurel crowns,” says Tertullian, “if so be he
  knows how many gods the devil has attached to
  doors.” And his words of warning are: “Since there
  are beings who are adored in entrances [doorways],
  it is to them that both the lamps and laurels will pertain.
  <span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>To an idol you will have done whatever you
  shall have done to an entrance [or doorway].” “If
  you have renounced [heathen] temples, make not
  your own gate a [heathen] temple.” Yet, in proof of
  the prevalence of this heathen custom among Christians,
  Tertullian testifies: “‘Let your works shine,’
  says He; but now all our shops and gates shine!
  You will now-a-days find more doors of heathens without
  lamps and laurel-wreaths than of Christians.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In Guatemala, in Central America, “the god of
  houses” is called Chahalka; and the blood of sacrifices
  to him is sprinkled on the door of the houses as
  an assurance of his protection.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c012'><sup>[260]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It was much the same in the Old World as in the
  New. In ancient and in modern times, and in widely
  different portions of the world, there are indications
  that the threshold of the home was the primitive
  altar; and that the side-posts and lintel of the doorway
  above the threshold bore symbols or inscriptions
  in proof of the sacredness of the entrance to the family
  home, and in token of an accomplished covenant with
  its guardian God, or gods.
