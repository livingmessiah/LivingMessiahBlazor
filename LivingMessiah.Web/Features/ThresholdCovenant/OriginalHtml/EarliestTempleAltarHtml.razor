  <h2 class='c005'>II. <br /> EARLIEST TEMPLE ALTAR.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1. FROM HOUSE TO TEMPLE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  A temple is only a more prominent house. As a
  house was the dwelling of the earlier priest of his
  household, who was in covenant for himself and his
  family with the guardian deity of that household;
  so, afterwards, a temple was a dwelling for the deity
  guarding an aggregation of families, and for the
  priests who stood between him and the community.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  This is no new or strange truth; it is obvious. “In
  the Vedas, Yama, as the first man, is the first priest
  too; he brought worship here below as well as life,
  and ‘first he stretched out the thread of sacrifice.’”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c012'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
  The fire-altar of the home was first the center of worship
  in the family in India;<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c012'><sup>[262]</sup></a> as later the fire-altar was
  the center of the worship of the community.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The same cuneiform characters in old Babylonian
  <span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>stand for great house, for palace, and for temple;<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c012'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
  as similarly, in ancient Egypt, the same hieroglyph
  represented house or temple,–a simple quadrangular
  enclosure, with its one doorway.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c012'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The oldest form of an Egyptian temple known
  to us through the inscriptions of the Ancient Empire
  indicates that the prehistoric houses of worship in
  that land were mere hovels of wood and lattice-work,
  over the doors of which was a barbaric ornamentation
  of bent pieces of wood.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a> The private house became
  the public temple.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The design of the Greek temple in its highest
  perfection was ... a gradual development of the
  dwelling-house.”<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a> Palace and temple were, indeed,
  often identical in ancient Greece.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Strictly speaking, there were no temples in ancient
  Persia, any more than in early India. But the fire-altars
  that were first on the home hearth, or threshold,
  were made more and more prominent on their uplifted
  stepped bases, until they towered loftily in the sight
  of their worshipers.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>It is the same Hebrew word, <em>ohel</em>, that stands for the
  “tent” of Abraham, and for the “Tent” or Tabernacle
  of the congregation of Israel.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In China “temple architecture differs little from
  that of the houses.”<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a> The house of a god is as the
  house of a man, only grander and more richly ornamented.
  And Japanese antiquaries say that the
  architecture of Shinto temples is on the model of the
  primeval Japanese hut. The temples of Ise, the most
  sacred of the Shinto sanctuaries, are said to represent
  this primitive architecture in its purest form.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The father of the family was the primitive priest in
  the Samoan Islands, and his house was the first place
  of worship. Then “the great house of the village,”
  or the place of popular assembling, was used as a
  temple; and afterwards there were special temple
  structures with attendant priests.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c012'><sup>[272]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The transition from house to temple seems to have
  been a gradual one in the primitive world. The
  fire-altar of the family came to be the fire-altar of the
  community of families. The house of a king became
  both palace and temple, and so again the house of a
  <span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>priest; for the offices of king and of priest were in
  early times claimed by the same person.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c012'><sup>[273]</sup></a>
</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. SACREDNESS OF THE DOOR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  In all stages of the transition from house to temple,
  the sacredness of the threshold, of the door, of the
  entrance-way, of the gate, was recognized in architecture
  and in ceremonial. Often the door, or the
  gate, stood for the temple, and frequently the threshold
  was an altar, or an altar was at the threshold.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There are, indeed, reasons for supposing that the
  very earliest form of a primitive temple, or sanctuary,
  or place of worship, was a rude doorway, as covering
  or as localizing the threshold altar. This would
  seem to be indicated by prehistoric remains in different
  parts of the world, as well as in the later development
  of the idea in the earlier historic ages. The
  only exception to this was where, as in India or Persia,
  the fire-altar on an uplifted threshold stood alone as
  a place of worship.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Two upright stone posts, with or without an overlaying
  stone across them, and with or without an
  altar stone between or before them, are among the
  most ancient remains of primitive man’s handiwork;
  and a similar design is to be recognized, all the way
  <span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>along in the course of history, down to the elaborate
  doorway standing by itself as a memorial of the
  revered dead,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c012'><sup>[274]</sup></a> or to the monumental triumphal arch
  as an accompaniment of the highest civilization.
  And the very name of door, or gate, attaches persistently
  to the loftiest temple and to the most exalted
  personage. As the earliest altar was the threshold,
  the earliest temple was a doorway above the altar at
  the threshold.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When the first dwellers on the plains of Chaldea,
  after the Deluge, gathered themselves for the building
  of a common structure reaching God-ward,<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c012'><sup>[275]</sup></a> they,
  in their phraseology, called that structure Bab-el, or
  Bâb-ilu, or Bâbi-ilu, the Door of God.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c012'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Ancient
  Egyptians called the sovereign head of their national
  family “<em>Per-ao</em>” (Pharaoh), the exalted House, or
  Gate, or Door;<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c012'><sup>[277]</sup></a> as to-day the Sultan, who is spiritual
  father of the faithful Muhammadans, and autocrat of
  his realm, is widely known as the “Sublime Porte,”
  or the Exalted Door.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c012'><sup>[278]</sup></a> The modern Babists, in Persia
  <span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>and beyond, look up to their spiritual head as the
  “Bab,” or the “Door.”<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a>  “Throughout the East
  this word [‘Bab’] signifies the court of a prince
  [as a ruler by divine right].... The threshold of
  the gate is used in the same sense, and frequently it
  is qualified by some epithet of nobility, loftiness, or
  goodness.”<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Jesus Christ did not hesitate to say of himself as
  the Way to God: “I am the Door: by me if any man
  enter in he shall be saved.”<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In China, Japan, Korea, Siam, and India, a gate, or
  doorway, usually stands before Confucian and Booddhist
  and Shinto temples, but apart from the temple,
  and always recognized as of peculiar sacredness.
  These doorways, in many places, are painted blood-color.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
  They stand “at the entrance of temple
  grounds, in front of shrines and sacred trees, and in
  every place associated with the native <em>kami</em>”–or
  gods.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Yet, again, in all these countries, the temple
  <span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>gateway is a main feature, or a prominent one, in the
  chief sanctuaries.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Swinging doors, or gates, are represented, in the
  religious symbolism of ancient Babylonia, as opening
  to permit the god Shamash, or the sun, to start out on
  his daily circuit of the heavens.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a> A door, or a doorway,
  appears as a shrine for a god in various cylinders
  from this region; and the god is shown standing
  within it, just beyond the threshold.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a> Indeed, the
  doorway shrine is a common form on the Babylonian
  and the Assyrian monuments, as a standing-place for
  the gods, and for the kings as representative of the
  gods.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Illustrations of this are found on the Balawat
  gates,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a> and the sculptures on the rocks at Nahr-el-Kelb<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a>–which
  is itself a gateway of the nations, between
  the mountains and the sea, on the route between
  Egypt and Canaan, and both the East and the West.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>In ancient Egypt the doorway shrine of the gods
  was prominent, as in Babylonia.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Moreover, a false
  door was represented in the earlier mastabahs, or
  tombs, of the Old Empire of Egypt. This representation
  of a door was toward the west, in which direction
  Osiris, the god of the under-world, was supposed
  to enter his realm as the sun went down. On
  or around this false door were memorial inscriptions,
  and prayers for the dead; and before it was a table,
  or altar, for offerings to the <em>ka</em>, or soul, of the dead.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c012'><sup>[291]</sup></a>
  Gradually this false door came to be recognized as
  the monumental slab, tablet, or stele, on which were
  inscribed the memorials of the deceased. As a doorway
  or a niche, square-topped, or arched, it was the
  shrine of the one worshiped; and as a panel, or independent
  stele, it was the place of record of the object
  of reverence.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “Even at the beginning of the Middle Empire the
  door form disappeared completely, and the whole
  space of the stone was taken up with the representation
  of the deceased sitting before a table of offerings,
  receiving gifts from his relatives and servants. Soon
  afterwards it became the custom to round off the stone
  <span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>at the top, and when, under the New Empire, pictures
  of a purely religious character took the place of the
  former representations, no one looking at the tomb
  stele could have guessed that it originated from the
  false door.”<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A “false door” was, in ancient Egypt, a valued gift
  from a sovereign to an honored subject. Doors of
  this kind were sometimes richly carved and painted,
  and were deemed of priceless value by the recipient.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In Phenicia,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a> Carthage,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a> Cyprus,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a> Sardinia,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a> Sicily,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a>
  and in Abyssinia,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a> a like prominence was given to the
  door as a door, in temple and in tomb, and as a niche
  for the figure of a deity or for the representation of
  one who had crossed the threshold of the new life.
  And the door-form is a sacred memorial of the dead
  in primitive lands in various parts of the world, from
  the rudest trilithon to the more finished structures of
  a high civilization.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In primitive New Zealand the gateway, or doorway,
  of a village, a cemetery, or a public building, is both
  <span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>a sacred image and a sacred passage-way. It is in the
  form of a superhuman personage, and it has its guardians
  on either hand.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A doorway with an altar between its posts was a
  symbol of religious worship in ancient Mexico, as in
  the far East.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It would seem that the “mihrab,” or prayer niche,
  pointing toward Meccah, in Muhammadan lands, and
  the Chinese honorary portals and ancestral tablets,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a> as
  well as the niches for images of saints in churches or
  at wayside shrines, or for heroes in public halls, in
  Christian lands, are a survival of the primitive doorway
  in a tomb.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  And wherever the door is prominent as a door, the
  threshold is recognized and honored as the floor of
  the door, and as the primitive altar above which the
  door is erected. To pass through the door is to cross
  over the threshold of the door.
</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN ASIA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  In all the modern excavations in the region of
  Babylonia and Assyria, including Tello, Nippur, Sippara,
  Borsippa, Khorsabad, and Nineveh, it has been
  <span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>found that the threshold, or foundation-stone, of the
  temple doorway is marked with inscriptions that show
  its peculiar sanctity; while underneath it, or near it,
  are frequently buried images and symbols and other
  treasures in evidence of its altar-like sacredness. On
  this point evidence has been furnished by Botta,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a>
  Bonomi,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a> Layard,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a> George Smith,<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a> Lenormant,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and
  yet more fully by Dr. Hilprecht, in his later and current
  researches.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Bonomi suggests that the word “teraphim,” as
  an image of a household divinity, has its connection
  with the threshold or the boundary limit; and that the
  phrase “thy going out, and thy coming in,” which is
  common in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Hebrew<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c012'><sup>[309]</sup></a> literature,
  has reference to the threshold and its protecting
  deities.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a> The outgoing and the incoming are
  clearly across the threshold and through the door.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The inscriptions of Nebuchadrezzar II., concerning
  his building of the walls of Babylon, comprise various
  references to the foundations, to the thresholds, and
  to their guardians. He says: “On the thresholds of
  <span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>the gates I set up mighty bulls of bronze, and mighty
  snakes standing upright.”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a> Again of the gates of
  Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bel, of these walls of Babylon,
  he says: “Their foundations I laid at the surface
  (down at) the water, with pitch and bricks. With
  blue enameled tiles which were adorned with bulls
  and large snakes, I built their interior cleverly. Strong
  cedars I laid over them as their covering (or roof).
  Doors of cedarwood with a covering of copper, a
  threshold (<em>askuppu</em>) and hinges of bronze, I set up
  in their gates. Strong bulls of bronze, and powerful
  snakes standing upright, I set upon (or at) their threshold
  (<em>sippu</em>). Those gates I filled with splendor for
  the astonishment of all mankind.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In a similar manner Nebuchadrezzar describes his
  work at the gates of “the royal castle of all mankind,”
  at Babylon,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a> and of his palace.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a> In connection
  with the shrine or chapel of Nebo (Ezida), within the
  walls of the temple of Merodach, in Babylon, he says:
  “Its threshold (<em>sippu</em>), its lock and its key, I plated
  with gold, and made the temple shine daylike.”<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a> When
  he built Ezida (the “eternal house”), the temple of
  <span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>Borsippa, Nebuchadrezzar says: “The bulls and the
  doors of the gate of the sanctuary, the threshold
  (<em>sippu</em>), the lock, the hinge, I plated with <em>zarîru</em>”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c012'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
  (an unknown metal, a kind of bronze).
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  References to the foundations, to the thresholds, to
  the gates and doorways, and to bulls and upright
  serpents, as the guardians of the threshold of the temples
  and palaces of Babylonia and Assyria, are numerous
  on unearthed cylinders and tablets, and always in
  such a way as to indicate their peculiar sacredness.
  In the recent unearthing, at Nippur, of a small building
  or shrine, between two great temples, an altar was
  found in the eastern doorway.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It is to be borne in mind that many early temples
  in Babylonia, as in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, in Mexico,
  Central America, and Peru, and in the South Sea
  Islands, were in the form of a stepped pyramid, or a
  staged tower, with either inclined planes or stairways
  from each lower stage to the next higher, and with
  an altar, or a sanctuary or shrine, at the summit.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a>
  Herodotus, describing one of these temples in Babylon,
  <span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>says that the altars, larger and smaller, were outside
  the temple.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Light is thrown on the dream of Jacob at Bethel by
  the shape of the ancient temple in the East. In his
  vision it was probably not a ladder, but a conventional
  stepped-temple structure, with its stairways rising
  heavenward, and its sanctuary, that Jacob saw.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c012'><sup>[319]</sup></a> The
  angel ministers were passing up and down the steps,
  in the service of the Most High God, who himself
  appeared above the structure. When Jacob waked
  he said: “Surely the Lord is in this place [or sanctuary];
  and I knew it not.... How dreadful is this
  place! this is none other but the house of God, and
  this is the gate of heaven;” and he took the stone
  which had been his pillow at the threshold of that
  sanctuary, and set it up for an altar pillar.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c012'><sup>[320]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the literature and legends of Babylonia, as of
  other portions of the ancient world, there is prominent
  the idea that an entrance into the life beyond this, as in
  the entrance into this life, the crossing of a threshold
  from the one world to the other, from the earlier state
  and the passing of a door, or gate, marks the change
  <span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>to the later, from the sacred to the more sacred.
  This is peculiarly illustrated in the famous legend of
  Ishtar’s descent into the under-world in order to bring
  back to earth her lover Dumuzi.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The Hades of the Babylonians was surrounded by
  seven high walls, and was approached through seven
  gates, each of which was guarded by a pitiless warder.
  Two deities ruled within it–Nergal, “the lord of the
  great city,” and Beltis-Allat, “the lady of the great
  land,”–whither everything which had breathed in this
  world descended after death. Allat was the actual
  sovereign of the country; and even the gods themselves
  could enter her realm only on the condition of
  submitting to death, like mortals, and of humbly
  avowing themselves her slaves.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c012'><sup>[321]</sup></a> “The <em>threshold</em> of
  Allat’s palace stood upon a spring, which had the
  property of restoring to life all who bathed in it or
  drank of its waters.” Yet it was needful that another
  life should be given for one who would be reborn into
  this life, after crossing the threshold of the regions
  beyond.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c012'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the descent of the goddess Ishtar into Allat’s
  realm, in pursuit of her lover Dumuzi, Ishtar was
  gradually stripped of her garments and adornings at
  <span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>the successive gates, until she appeared naked, as at
  birth, at the final threshold of the new state.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c012'><sup>[323]</sup></a> But she
  was held captive by Allat until Ea, chief among the
  gods, exerted himself in her behalf, and sent his messenger
  to secure for both Ishtar and Dumuzi the
  waters of life which were underneath the threshold
  of Allat’s realm,–which must be broken in order to
  their outflowing.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There would seem to be a reference to this primitive
  idea of the waters of life flowing from under the
  threshold of the temple, in the vision of the prophet
  Ezekiel, writing in Babylonia, concerning restored
  Jerusalem and its holy temple. “Behold, waters
  issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward,
  for the forefront of the house was toward the
  east: and the waters came down from under, from the
  right side of the house, on the south of the altar.”
  (Evidently the altar in this temple was near the threshold.)
  These flowing waters from under the threshold
  were life-giving. “Upon the bank of the river,” as it
  swelled in its progress, “were very many trees on the
  one side and on the other;” and it was said of this
  stream: “It shall come to pass, that every living creature
  which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers
  come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish:
  <span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>for these waters are come thither, ... and
  every thing shall live whithersoever the river cometh.”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
  In a curse pronounced against Assyria by the prophet
  Zephaniah, it was declared that “drought shall be in
  the thresholds,”<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a> instead of life-giving waters.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  So, again, the waters of the life-giving Jordan flow
  out from the threshold of the grotto of Pan, a god

  This Dumuzi of Babylonia has linkings with Tammuz
  of Syria, with Osiris of Egypt, and with Adonis
  of Greece, and there are correspondences in all these
  legends in the references to the door and the threshold
  of the under-world and the life beyond. Thus, for
  instance, the Lord’s prophet counts as most heinous
  of all idolatries the transfer of the weeping worship of
  Tammuz from the door in the hole of the temple wall
  to the door of the temple sanctuary.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a>

  At the right hand of the entrance of the larger
  temple unearthed at Nineveh by Layard, a sculptured
  image of the Assyrian king, with his arm uplifted,
  was on a doorway stele just outside. And an
  altar for offerings was in front of that image. Altars
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>were found similarly situated, just outside the doorway,

  An exceptional reverence is shown to the doorway
  and threshold of their sanctuary, or temple, by the
  sect of the Yezidis, in the neighborhood of ancient
  Nineveh, at the present time. Describing an evening
  service which he attended, Layard says: “When the
  prayers were ended, those who marched in procession
  kissed, as they passed by, the right side of the
  doorway leading into the temple, where a serpent is
  figured on the wall.” Again, “Soon after sunrise, on
  the following morning, the sheikhs and cawals offered
  up a short prayer in the court of the temple.... Some
  prayed in the sanctuary, frequently kissing the threshold
  and holy places within the building.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  When the sacred ark of the Hebrews was captured
  by the Philistines, and brought into the house of the
  god Dagon, the record is: “When they of Ashdod
  arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen
  upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
  Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his
  place again. And when they arose early on the morrow
  morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face
  to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the
  head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay
  <span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>cut off upon the threshold.” It is added, in our
  present Bible text: “Therefore neither the priests of
  Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on
  the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.”<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  It would seem, from the words “unto this day,”
  that this added statement was a gloss by a later writer
  or copyist. The original force of the wonder was in
  Dagon’s being overthrown at his very shrine, falling
  maimed on the threshold altar of his temple. But the
  suggestion of the gloss is that the unwillingness of
  the Philistines to tread on the threshold of the temple
  (which appears to have been of primitive origin) did
  not exist among the worshipers of Dagon prior to
  this incident. The Septuagint adds,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a> concerning the
  later practice of the Philistines at the threshold, “because
  leaping they leap over it.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Leaping over the threshold is at times spoken of in
  the Bible as if it had a taint of idolatry. Thus Zephaniah,
  foretelling, in the name of the Lord, the divine
  judgments on idolaters, says: “In that day I will
  punish all those that leap over the threshold.”<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a> This
  is explained in the Targum as “those that walk in the
  customs of the Philistines.” Yet the Bible sometimes
  refers to the temple threshold as a fitting place
  of worship, and its recognition as a holy altar as commendable.

  That it was the threshold or doorway of the tabernacle

  “Is a man accused of a great crime? He goes to the
  temple [threshold], makes his prostrations; he pauses,
  then steps over it, declaring at the same time that he is

  Bloody sacrifices are still known at the temple

  When a famous idol was destroyed in the temple

<h3 class='c010'>4. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN AFRICA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  The oldest temple discovered in Egypt is little
  more than a doorway with an altar at its threshold,
  and with a stele on either side of the altar. This
  temple is near the base of the stepped pyramid of
  Meydoom, dating back probably to the beginning of
  the fourth dynasty.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c012'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Later, in Egypt, as in early Babylonia, the doorway,
  above the threshold, had peculiar sacredness, in
  the temples and in the approaches to the under-world.
  <span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>The pylon, or propylon, of an Egyptian temple, was a
  monumental gateway before the temple, and exalted
  honor attached to it. It frequently gave its name to
  the entire temple.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c012'><sup>[367]</sup></a> The side towers of this gateway
  are said to have represented Isis and Nephthys, and
  the door itself between these towers stood for Osiris,
  the judge of the living and the dead.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c012'><sup>[368]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There was indeed a temple in Thebes which bore
  the name of “Silver Threshold.” This temple “is
  mentioned in the time of the twenty-first dynasty;
  and it cannot have been earlier than the eighteenth
  dynasty, when silver was growing cheaper in Egypt.”<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c012'><sup>[369]</sup></a>
  But the prominence of the “threshold” in the designation
  of the “temple” is aside from the question of
  the time of the use of silver.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The winged sun disk was placed above all the
  doors into the temples, that the image of Horus
  might drive away all unclean spirits from the sacred
  building.”<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c012'><sup>[370]</sup></a> These overshadowing wings marked the
  special sacredness of the doors beneath them.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When an Egyptian priest opened the door of the
  <span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>shrine–the holy of holies of the temple–he must
  prostrate himself at the threshold in reverent worship.
  “According to the Theban rite, ... as soon as he saw
  the image of the god he had to ‘kiss the ground,
  throw himself on his face, throw himself entirely on
  his face, kiss the ground with his face turned downward,
  offer incense,’ and then greet the god with a
  short petition.”<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c012'><sup>[371]</sup></a> This priestly worship was at the
  threshold of the shrine.

  The Egyptian idea of the future life, and of the
  world beyond this, had marked correspondences with
  the Babylonian. Osiris presided over the under-world,
  as, indeed, he was the chief object of worship in this.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c012'><sup>[372]</sup></a>

  new life he was the friend and helper of those who
  struggled against evil.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c012'><sup>[373]</sup></a> He was in a peculiar sense
  the door of the life beyond this, “Osiris, opening the
  ways of the two worlds;”<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c012'><sup>[374]</sup></a> and those who passed
  that door safely were identified with himself in the
  under-world.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c012'><sup>[375]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  A closed door toward the west, in a tomb, represented

  <span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>shown in the “Book of the Dead” the approach to Osiris
  was by a series of doors, which could be passed only
  by one who showed his identification with Osiris, and
  his worthiness as such.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c012'><sup>[377]</sup></a> At the entrance to the Hall
  of the Two Truths, or of the Two-fold Maāt,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c012'><sup>[378]</sup></a> as the
  place of final judgment, the deceased was challenged
  by the threshold of the door, by the two side-posts, by
  the lock, by the key, and by the door itself; and he
  could not pass these unless he proved his oneness with
  Osiris by his knowledge of their names severally.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A saint’s tomb, called a <em>wely</em>, is a common place of
  worship in Egypt. Sometimes a mosk is built over
  it, and sometimes it serves as a substitute for a mosk,
  where no mosk is near. “At least one such building
  forms a conspicuous object close by, or within, almost
  every Arab village;” and these tombs are frequently
  visited by those who would make supplication for
  themselves, or intercession for others, or who would
  do a worthy act, and merit a correspondent blessing.
  “Many a visitor, on entering the tomb, kisses the
  threshold, or touches it with his right hand, which he
  then kisses.”<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a> Similar customs prevail in Arabia and

<p class='c011'>
  Traces of the primitive sacredness of the doorway
  and the threshold, in places of worship, are to be
  found in Europe, ancient and modern, as in Asia and
  Africa.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The term “threshold” occurs in such prominence
  in connection with temples, in the earliest Greek literature,
  as to show that its primitive meaning included
  the idea of altar, or of sanctuary foundation. Thus
  the House of Zeus on Olympus is repeatedly spoken
  of as the “House of the Bronze Threshold.”<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a> In
  these references, “the nature of the occurrences, the
  uniformity of the phrase, the position of the words in
  the verse, all point to this as an old hieratic phrase,
  and the meaning evidently is, ‘the house that is stablished
  forever.’”<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  This term “bronze threshold” occurs more than
  once in reference to the temple-palace of Alcinoüs.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a>
  Tartarus is described as having gates of iron and a
  “bronze threshold.”<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a> Night and day meet as they
  cross the “great threshold of bronze;” and Atlas upholds
  heaven at the threshold of the under-world.<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>The treasures of Delphi are described as “within
  the stone threshold of the archer god, Phoebus Apollo,
  in Rocky Pytho.”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a> And he who seeks counsel at that
  oracle is spoken of as one who crosses “the stone

<p class='c000'>
  In Sophocles’ “Oedipus at Colonus” the Athenian
  warns the stranger Oedipus that he is on holy ground,
  in the realm of Poseidon, and that the spot where he
  now treads is “called the brazen threshold of the
  land, the stay of Athens.”<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c012'><sup>[393]</sup></a> In other words, the
  bronze threshold is an archaic synonym for the enduring
  border, or outer limit, of spiritual domain.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  This prominence given to the threshold in earlier
  Greek literature is not, it is true, continued in later
  writings; yet there are traces of it still in occasional
  poetic references to the “threshold of life,” and the
  “threshold of the year,” and the “threshold of old
  age.” When Homer refers “to houses, to rooms in
  houses, or to courtyards, the ‘threshold’ is constantly
  spoken of: a man steps over a threshold, stands at a
  threshold, sits at a threshold, etc. And so important
  is the threshold that its material is almost regularly
  mentioned; it is ash, oak, stone, bronze, etc. In later
  times all these locutions disappear; men go through
  <span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>doorways, enter, stand in porches, etc., instead.”<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c012'><sup>[394]</sup></a> Yet
  it is the archaic use that points to the primitive prominence
  of the threshold.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In historic times, however, as in earlier, the altar of
  sacrifice was to be found, in Grecian and Roman
  temples, near the threshold of the door. While there
  were smaller altars, for the offering of incense and
  bloodless sacrifices, in the interior of temples, the
  larger and more important altars, for the offering of
  animal sacrifices, whether of beasts or of men, were
  before the temple, in front of the threshold,–<em>

  A ruined temple of Artemis Propylæa, at Eleusis,
  shows the main altar immediately before the threshold,
  between the antæ. The altar of the temple of
  Apollo at Delphi was in a like position; as shown in
  the fact that “when Neoptolemus is attacked by
  Orestes in the vestibule of the temple at Delphi, he
  seizes the arms which were suspended by means of
  nails or pins from one of the antæ, takes his station
  upon the altar, and addresses the people in his own
  defense.”<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c012'><sup>[396]</sup></a>

  When the “priest of Jupiter, whose temple was
  <span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>before the city” of Lystra, would have given divine
  honors to Paul and Barnabas, he brought the garlanded
  oxen “unto the gates,” to sacrifice them there.
  At the gate of the city, within which the supposed gods
  were to be found, seemed the proper place of sacrifice.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c012'><sup>[397]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  There are references in classic story, as in Babylonian
  legends, in Phenician and Syrian beliefs, and in
  the Hebrew prophetic visions, to life-giving waters
  flowing out from under the threshold of the sanctuary.
  In the garden of the palace-temple of Alcinoüs “are
  two springs, the one ripples through the whole garden,
  the other opposite it gushes under the threshold
  of the courtyard to the lofty house, and from it the
  citizens draw their water.”<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c012'><sup>[398]</sup></a> On “the apple-growing
  shores of the Hesperides,” where Atlas upholds “the
  holy threshold of heaven,” according to the poets,
  “springs of ambrosia pour from the chamber of Zeus,
  from his bedside,” and give a rich blessing to the life-giving
  earth.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c012'><sup>[399]</sup></a> And of Delphi it is said: “Going toward
  the temple we come upon the spring Cassotis:
  there is a low wall about it, and you ascend to the
  spring through the walls. The water of this Cassotis
  they say sinks underground, and in the shrine of the
  god [Apollo] makes the woman prophetic [is inspiration
  to her.]”<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c012'><sup>[400]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>In the early churches of Europe, the threshold
  marked a sacred boundary of the edifice, to cross
  which indicated a certain covenant right to participate
  in the privileges of the house of God. As the structure
  of the churches changed, in the progress of the
  centuries, the threshold of the sanctuary came to be
  in a different portion of the building, or series of buildings;
  but its sacredness remained, wherever it was
  supposed to be. The term “altar” also changed, from
  the border line of the place of worship, to the holy
  table within the sanctuary.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Speaking of the growth of the early church buildings,
  Bingham says: “In the strictest sense, including
  only the buildings within the walls, they were commonly
  divided into three parts: (1.) The <em>narthex</em> or
  ante-temple, where the penitents and catechumens
  stood. (2.) The <em>naos</em> or temple, where the communicants
  had their respective places. And (3.) the <i>bēma</i>
  or sanctuary, where the clergy stood to officiate at
  the altar. But in a larger sense there was another
  ante-temple or <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">narthex</span></em> without the walls, under which
  was comprised the propylæa, or <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestibulum</span></em>, the outward
  porch; then the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">atrium</span></em> or area, the court leading
  from that to the temple, surrounded with porticos
  or cloisters.... There were also several <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedræ</span></em>, such
  as the baptistery, the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">diaconicum</span></em>, the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pastophoria</span></em>, and
  other adjacent buildings, which were reckoned to be
  <span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>either without or within the church, according as it
  was taken in a stricter or a larger acceptation.”<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c012'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In the early churches, the place of baptism was outside
  of the church proper, or the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">naos</span></em>, it is said.
  “There is nothing more certain than that for many
  ages the baptistery was a distinct place from the body
  of the church, and reckoned among the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedræ</span></em>, or
  places adjoining to the church.”<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c012'><sup>[402]</sup></a>  “The first  ages  all
  agreed in this, that, whether they had baptisteries or
  not, the place of baptism was always without the
  church.”<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c012'><sup>[403]</sup></a> Even in mediæval times, in the churches
  of England, baptisms were on the outer side of the
  threshold of the church proper, “the child being held
  without the doors of the church”<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c012'><sup>[404]</sup></a> until baptized. In
  many churches of Europe at the present time the baptismal
  font is at or near the door of the church.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In 1661, a formal reply of the Church of England
  bishops to a request of the Presbyterians that the
  font might be placed before the congregation, that all
  might see it, was: “The font usually stands, as it did
  in primitive times, at or near the church door, to
  signify that baptism was the entrance into the church
  mystical.”<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c012'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>Marriages, like baptisms, were at the church porch
  or outside of the threshold. “The old missals direct
  the placing of the man and the woman at the church
  door during the service, and that at the end of it
  they shall proceed within up to the altar.”<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c012'><sup>[406]</sup></a> The
  idea would seem to be that a holy covenant like
  marriage, which is the foundation of a new family,
  must be solemnized at the primitive family altar,–the
  threshold.

<p class='c000'>
  Describing the marriage rites of Germany in the
  middle ages, Baring-Gould says:  “In a Ritual of
  Rennes, of the eleventh century, we find a rubric to
  this effect: ‘The priest shall go before the door of the
  church in surplice and stole, and ask the bridegroom
  and bride prudently whether they desire to be legally
  united; and then he shall make the parents give her
  away, according to the usual custom, and the bridegroom
  shall fix the dower, announcing before all
  present what (witthum) he intends to give the bride.
  Then the priest shall make him betroth her with a
  ring, and give her an honorarium of gold or silver
  according to his means. Then let him give the prescribed
  benediction. After which, entering into the
  church, let him begin mass; and let the bridegroom
  and bride hold lighted candles, and make an oblation
  at the offertory; and before the Pax let the priest
  <span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>bless them before the altar under a pall or other covering
  [the wedding canopy], according to custom; and
  lastly, let the bridegroom receive the kiss of peace
  from the priest, and pass it on to his bride.’”<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c012'><sup>[407]</sup></a>

  “In ancient times the people of France were married,
  not within the church at the altar as now, but at the
  outer door. This was the case in 1599, in which year
  Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry II., was married to
  Philip II. of Spain; and the Bishop of Paris performed
  the ceremony at the door of the cathedral of Notre
  Dame. Another instance of this kind occurred in
  1599 in France. Henrietta Maria was married to
  King Charles by proxy at the door of Notre Dame,
  and the bride, as soon as the ceremony was over
  entered the church, and assisted at [attended] mass.”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c012'><sup>[408]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “The pre-Reformation rule was to begin the marriage
  service at the door of the church. In his ‘Wyf

  This old usage was abandoned by authority in the
  time of Edward VI. Yet there is reason for thinking
  that it was not entirely given up. “There is a poem
  of Herrick’s, written about 1640, which is entitled,
  <span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>‘The Entertainment or Porch Verse at the Marriage

<p class='c000'>
  “At Witham in Essex it is, or was, the custom to
  perform the first part of the marriage service at the
  font [near the door]. When the Rev. A. Snell was
  appointed to the benefice in 1873, he spoke to a bridegroom
  about this usage, and he (the bridegroom)
  particularly requested that he might be married at
  the font, as he liked old customs.”<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c012'><sup>[411]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  Another survival of the primitive rite of threshold
  covenanting seems to be shown in certain customs
  observed in various parts of Europe, which look like
  the substitution of an altar-stone for a threshold altar,
  in the marriage ceremony.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  “Thus in the old temple of Upsal [in Sweden],
  wedding couples stood upon a broad stone which was
  believed to cover the tomb of St. Eric.”<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c012'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Corresponding
  customs in other regions would go to show
  <span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>that the earlier practice was to leap over the stone,
  as a mode of threshold covenanting, instead of standing
  on it. The latter was a change without a reason
  for it.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  For instance, just outside “the ruined church, or
  abbey, of Lindisfarne, is the socket or foot-stone, in
  which was mortised a ponderous stone cross, erected
  by Ethelwold, and broken down by the Danes. This
  socket stone is now called the “petting stone,” and
  whenever a marriage is solemnized in the neighborhood,
  after the ceremony the bride is obliged to step
  upon it; and if she cannot stride to the end thereof,
  the marriage is deemed likely to prove unfortunate
  and fruitless.” While this would seem to point to the
  custom of standing upon the stone, in the modern
  marriage customs of the same region, a barrier is
  “erected at the churchyard gate, consisting of a large
  paving-stone which was placed on its edge and supported
  by two smaller stones. On either side stood a
  villager, who made the couple and every one else
  jump over it.”<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c012'><sup>[413]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  At Belford, in Northumberland, it is still the custom
  to make the bridal pair, with their attendants, leap
  over a stone placed in their path outside the church
  porch. This stone also is called the “petting stone,”
  or the “louping stone.” At the neighboring village
  of Embleton, in the same county, two stout young
  lads place a wooden bench across the door of the
  church porch, and assist the bride and groom and
  their attendants to surmount the obstacle; for which
  assistance a gift of money is expected. In some
  places a stick has been held by the groomsmen at
  the church door for the bride to jump over. And
  again a stool has been placed at the churchyard gate,
  over which the whole bridal party must jump one
  by one; and this stool has been called the “parting-stool.”<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c012'><sup>[415]</sup></a>

  A “mode of marriage” current in Ireland, until

  cross;<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c012'><sup>[416]</sup></a> and jumping over a broomstick as a form of
  marriage would seem to be a survival of this custom
  of leaping across the threshold-stone, in token of a
  covenant. “Jumping the broomstick” is sometimes
  spoken of as an equivalent of marriage.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  These various obstacles to progress, at wedding
  time, would seem to be as suggestions of the threshold
  altar, which must be passed in the marriage covenant.
  The church threshold, like the home threshold,
  is a temporary hindrance to an advance. Unless it is
  stepped across, the covenant is incomplete.

<p class='c000'>
  An illustration of the popular idea of the sacredness
  of the church threshold, and of the impropriety of
  stepping on it, in its passing, is found in a Finnish
  mode of judging a clergyman. “In Finland, it is
  regarded as unlucky if a clergyman steps on the
  threshold, when he comes to preach at a church.” A
  writer on this subject says: “A Finnish friend told
  me of one of his relations going to preach at a church,
  a few years ago,–he being a candidate for the vacant
  living,–and the people most anxiously watched if he
  stepped on the threshold as he came in. Had he
  done so, I fear a sermon never so eloquent would
  have counted but little against so dire an omen.”<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c012'><sup>[417]</sup></a>

<h3 class='c010'>6. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  In the West, as in the East, traces of the primitive
  sacredness of the threshold and the doorway are to be
  found. The stepped pyramid, or uplifted threshold,
  with the sanctuary at its summit, was the earliest form
  of temple or place of worship in Mexico, and in Central
  and South America. In the later and more elaborate
  temples there was no altar within the building,
  although an image of the god was there.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The altar, or stone of sacrifice, was without, before
  the door of the sanctuary.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c012'><sup>[419]</sup></a> When a sacrifice was

  Human sacrifices were included in these offerings,
  <span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>in earlier times.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c012'><sup>[421]</sup></a> Even when larger temples were
  erected, and altars were enclosed within them, human
  victims were brought to the temple entrance into
  the hands of the priests; and from the threshold they
  were borne by the priests themselves, to be laid on
  the altar.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c012'><sup>[422]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  Among the Pipiles, a Maya people, in Central
  America, there were “two principal and very solemn
  sacrifices; one at the commencement of summer, and
  the other at the beginning of winter.” Little boys,
  from six to twelve years old, were the victims of sacrifice.
  At the sound of trumpets and drums, which
  assembled the people, four priests came out of the
  temple with braziers of coals on which incense was
  burning, and after various ceremonies and religious
  exercises they proceeded to the house of the high-priest,
  near the temple, and took from it the boy victim
  of the sacrifice. He was then conducted four
  times round the court of the temple, with dancing
  and singing.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  When this ceremony was finished, the high-priest
  came out of his house with the second priest and his
  major-domo, and they proceeded to the temple steps,
  accompanied by the principal men of the locality,
  who, however, stopped at the threshold of the temple.
  <span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>Then and there the four priests “seized the victim by
  his extremities, and the major-domo coming out, with
  little bells on his wrists and ankles, opened the left
  breast of the boy, tore out his heart, and handed it to
  the high-priest, who put it into a little embroidered
  purse, which he closed.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  The blood of the victim was received by the priests
  in a vessel made of a gourd, and was by them sprinkled
  in the direction of the four cardinal points. Then the
  heart, in its purse, was put back into the body of the
  victim, and the body itself was interred inside of
  the temple. This sacrifice, at the threshold altar, was
  performed at the threshold, or the beginning, of each
  of the two chief seasons of the year.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c012'><sup>[423]</sup></a>

  In the temples of Central America, generally, the
  doorway was hardly less prominent than in the temples
  of Egypt. There were massive decorations on and
  above the lintels; the door jams were richly sculptured;
  and there were male and female figures, or
  figures of animals, as guardians on either side of the
  entrance. In some instances a winged globe was
  above the door; and the uplifted hand was found over
  the doorway or at the sides.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c012'><sup>[424]</sup></a>

  <span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>Among the Natchez Indians, along the lower Mississippi,
  there was an annual “Harvest Festival,” or
  “Festival of New Fire,” which was celebrated with
  great ceremony. An altar was in front of the temple,
  just before the door. On this occasion the priest
  of the sun stood on the threshold of the temple in
  the early morning, watching for the first rays of the
  rising sun. The chiefs, and braves old and young,
  stood near the altar. The women with infants in
  their arms stood in a semicircle facing the priest.
  When he gave the signal of his recognition of the
  sun, by rubbing two pieces of wood to start a new fire
  for the altar, they faced about to the east and held up
  their infants to the sun. Other exercises of worship
  followed. The priest’s place in this ceremony was on
  the threshold, before the altar of that temple.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c012'><sup>[425]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  In America, as in the other continents, there are
  survivals of the primal sacredness of the threshold of
  a place of public worship, in the formal ceremonies
  attending the laying of the corner-stone, or threshold-stone,
  of a new church building of any denomination;
  and in the use of holy water at the doorway on entering
  Roman Catholic churches. More or less importance
  is attached in Protestant Episcopal churches to
  the location of the baptismal font near the door, and
  <span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>to the beginning of the marriage service before the
  bridal party approaches the threshold of the sanctuary
  proper.

  If indeed, there be found no trace of the fountain of

<h3 class='c010'>7.  TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN ISLANDS OF THE SEA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>
  There is a certain resemblance in the plan of some
  of the temples of the South Sea Islands to those of
  Central America. A stepped pyramid in a large court
  was the central shrine; “in front of which the images
  were kept, and the altars fixed.”<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c012'><sup>[426]</sup></a> In both cases the
  altars were outside of the shrine,–at its threshold, as it
  were. A method of sacrificing was by bleeding a pig
  to death before the altar, “washing the carcass with
  the blood, and then placing it in a crouching position
  on the altar.”<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c012'><sup>[427]</sup></a> An uplifted hand was one of the symbols
  on these stepped pyramid shrines.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c012'><sup>[428]</sup></a> The temple
  foundation, or the threshold of the sacred building,
  was formerly laid in human blood.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c012'><sup>[429]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A recognition of the threshold, in a sacred service,
  and in a form of covenanting, is found in the ceremonies
  <span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>of circumcision as observed in Madagascar.
  This rite is not at infancy, as among the Jews, but is
  at the threshold of young manhood. Its period is
  fixed by the king, who, on “an application from the
  parents or the friends of any number of children in a
  given province, appoints a time, and orders the observance
  of the rite.” He is the “high-priest on this
  occasion.” The rite marks the transition of the boy
  from his dependence on his parents to his personal service
  of the king, as a member of the community.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Holy water is brought from a distance to the house
  of the master of ceremonies, as the sanctuary for the
  occasion. A sheep is killed immediately before this
  house, and the boys are caused to step across its
  blood. This sacrifice is called “fahazza,” or “causing
  fruitfulness,” and it is supposed to be the means of
  causing fruitfulness in all the women who obtain a
  share of it.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  A tree is planted at the northeast corner of the
  house, and a lamp is fixed on it. Honey and water
  are poured upon the tree, and the boys partake of this
  mixture. The next day the persons present walk
  three times round the house, with various ceremonies,
  and then stop at the doorway. The rite of circumcision
  is performed on each boy as he sits on a drum
  at “the threshold of the door,” held firmly by several
  men. The knife with which it is performed is previously
  <span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>dipped in the blood of a young bullock, an
  ear of which is slit by the operator. A covenant of
  fealty to the king is entered into by the youth on this
  occasion. Sacrifices and feasting follow this ceremony.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c012'><sup>[430]</sup></a>

  One of the ancient gods of Maui, an island of
  Hawaii, was Keoroeva. “In all the temples dedicated
  to its worship, the image was placed within the inner
  apartment, on the left-hand side of the door; and immediately
  before it stood the altar, on which the offerings
  of every kind were usually placed.”<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c012'><sup>[431]</sup></a> The altar
  was at the doorway, in this case, as so generally elsewhere.
  Tiha was a female idol, as Keoroeva was a
  male, and much “the same homage and offerings”
  were given to her as to him.<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c012'><sup>[432]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  In Kohala, one of the large divisions of Hawaii,
  stood a prominent temple called Bukohōla, built by
  King Kamehameha, at the time of his conquest of the
  Sandwich Islands. “At the south end of this great
  edifice was a kind of inner court, which might be
  called the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></em> of the temple, where the
  principal idol used to stand, surrounded by a number
  of images of inferior deities.” “On the outside, near
  the entrance to the inner court [at the threshold of the
  <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></em>] was the place of the <em>rere</em> [or <em>lélé</em>]
  <span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>(altar), on which human and other sacrifices were
  offered.”<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c012'><sup>[433]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Human victims were ordinarily slain in sacrifice
  outside of the sanctuary proper, and then their bodies,
  carefully preserved whole, were taken within to be
  presented to the idol.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c012'><sup>[434]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  There were Hawaiian cities of refuge, or <em>puhonuas</em>,
  as sanctuaries for guilty fugitives. A thief, or a murderer,
  might be pursued to the very gateway of one
  of those cities, but as soon as he crossed the threshold
  of that gate, even though the gate were open, and no
  barrier hindered pursuit, he was safe, as at the city
  altar. When once within the sacred city, the fugitive’s
  first duty was to present himself before the idol,
  and return thanks for his protection.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c012'><sup>[435]</sup></a> This was substantially
  the Hebrew law as to the cities of refuge.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c012'><sup>[436]</sup></a>
  Safety was only within the threshold.

<p class='c000'>
  There are traces of the primitive idea of a spring of
  life-giving waters flowing from under the threshold of
  the goddess of life, in the Islands of the Sea. According
  to the myths of that region, Vari, or “The-very-beginning”
  of life was a woman. She plucked off a
  <span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>piece of her right side and it became a man, or part
  man and part fish, known as Vātea, or Avatea. From
  the under-world there came to Vātea a supernatural
  woman called Papa, or Foundation. From this union
  the human race began. Rongo was the first-born son.
  The Hades of Polynesia is Avaika, or Hawaika. In
  the days of Rongo, and later, there was an opening
  from earth to Avaika; but because of the misdoings
  of the denizens of that realm, coming up through that
  passage-way, Tiki, a lovely woman, a descendant of
  Rongo, “rolled herself alive down into the gloomy
  opening, which immediately closed upon her.” She
  was the first to die. And now “Tiki sits at the threshold”
  of her home below, to welcome the descendants
  of Rongo, who bring her an offering. A sacred
  stream of water, “Vairorongo,” comes up from below
  into the sacred grove devoted to the worship of
  Rongo, and near that stream it is possible for a spirit
  to be returned to life and to a home on earth again.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c012'><sup>[437]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  It is obvious that the idea of the sacredness of the
  threshold, in home, in temple, or in sanctuary, is not
  of any one time or of any one people, but is of human
  nature as human nature everywhere. It shows itself
  all the world over, and always. And it has to do with
  life, and its perpetuation or reproduction.

  <h3 class='c010'>8. ONLY ONE FOUNDATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>
  An idea tangent to, rather than identical with, the
  thought of the altar sacredness of the temple threshold,
  as found among primitive peoples, is that the first
  temple foundation is the foundation for all subsequent
  temple building at that place. And it has already
  been shown that the threshold, or hearthstone, or
  corner-stone, is considered the foundation.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c012'><sup>[438]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  In ancient Babylonia a temple, however grand and
  extensive, was supposed to be built on the foundation
  of an earlier temple; the one threshold being
  the first threshold and the latest. If, indeed, there
  was a variation from the original foundation in the
  construction of a new temple, there was confusion and
  imperfectness in consequence, and the only hope of
  reformation was in finding the first temple threshold
  and rebuilding on it.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  There is an illustration of this in an inscription discovered
  in the foundation of a temple at “Ur of the
  Chaldees.”<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a> Nabonidus (556–538 B.C.), the last Babylonian
  king, tells with interest of his search for the
  old foundation, or outline plan, of the ancient temple,
  Eulbar, or, more properly, Eulmash, of the goddess
  Istar of Agade, as follows:<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c012'><sup>[440]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  <span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>The foundation of Eulmash in Agade had not been
  found from Sargon, king of Babylon (3800 B.C.), and
  Narâm-Sin, his son, kings living formerly, until the
  government of Nabunaʾid king of Babylon.
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  King Kurigalzu (II.), about 1300 B.C., had, in his
  reign, searched for this foundation, but had failed to
  find it, and he had left this record: “The foundation
  of Eulmash I sought, but did not find it.” Later on,
  Esarhaddon, king of Assyria and Babylonia (681–669
  B.C.), searched for it, but without success. Again,
  Nebuchadrezzar (605–561 B.C.) mobilized his large
  armies, and ordered them to search for the foundation
  stone, or threshold, but all his efforts were in vain.
  Finally Nabunaʾid, the last king of Babylon before its
  fall under Cyrus, gathered his many soldiers, and
  ordered them to search for the foundation stone. For
  “three years in the tracks of Nebuchadrezzar king
  of Babylon,” says Nabunaʾid, “I sought right and
  left, before and behind, but did not find it.”
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Encouraged by a prompting from the moon-god
  Sin, Nabunaʾid tried at another time and in another
  place, and this time with success. He found the inscription
  of King Shagarakti-Buriash (1350 B.C.),
  which tells that he had laid a new foundation exactly
  upon the old one of King Zabû (about 2300 B.C.).
  Then Nabunaʾid made sure to preserve the exact outline
  of the old shrine. He laid the foundation, and
  <span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>restored the ancient temple, so that “it did not deviate
  an inch to the outside or the inside.”<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c012'><sup>[441]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  There are indications of the same high value set
  upon the primal foundation of a temple in the records
  of ancient Egypt. A temple at its highest grandeur
  is in the location of a prehistoric sanctuary. “The
  site on which it is built is generally <em>holy ground</em>,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c012'><sup>[442]</sup></a> that
  is, a spot on which since the memory of man an older
  sanctuary of the god had stood. Even those Egyptian
  temples which seem most modern have usually a
  long history,–the edifice may have seemed very insignificant,
  but as the prestige of the god increased
  larger buildings were erected, which again, in the
  course of centuries, were enlarged and rebuilt in such
  a way that the original plan could no longer be traced.
  This is the history of nearly all Egyptian temples, and
  explains the fact that we know so little of the temples
  of the Old and of the Middle Empire; they have all
  been metamorphosed into the vast buildings of the
  New Empire.”<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c012'><sup>[443]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  While early Vedic and Brahmanic religion makes
  no mention of temples as such, fire from an ancestral
  altar was borne to a newly erected altar, in order to
  secure a continuance of the sacred influences issuing
  <span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>from that original family threshold.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c012'><sup>[444]</sup></a> And Vishnooism

  “Buddha-Gaya,” or “Bodhi-Gaya,” in Upper India,
  is famous as the locality of the holy pipal tree, or the
  Booddha-drum (“Tree of Knowledge”), under which
  for six years sat Sakya Sinha, in meditation, before he
  attained to Booddha-hood. A temple still standing on
  that site is supposed to have been rebuilt A.D. 1306,
  on the remains of one visited by Hwen Thsang, a
  Chinese traveler, in the seventh century of our era,
  which, in turn, had been built by Amara Sinha, or
  Amara Deva, about A.D. 500. This earlier temple is
  said to have been built by a command of Booddha
  himself conveyed in a vision, or by a command of the
  Brahmanical Mahâdeva, on the site of a still earlier
  sanctuary, or monastery, erected by Asoka between
  259 and 241 B.C., on the site of Booddha’s meditations,
  about 300 B.C.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c012'><sup>[445]</sup></a> The existing temple has been

  was built on a site that was sacred long before Sivaism
  was known. It is even believed that the sacredness
  of this site runs back to the ancient times of the
  Rig Veda. The boundaries of this “Holy Land” are
  given in the great Hindoo epic, the Mahabharata.
  This plain is said to comprise three hundred and

  So general, in India, is this habit of building a sanctuary

  Fourteen centuries before Christ, Pan-Kăng, an emperor
  of China, moved his capital from north of the
  Ho to south of it because he had ascertained that the
  original foundation was attempted to be laid there by
  his ancestor Thang in the Shing dynasty, seventeen
  reigns before him; hence the removal back to that

  A temple has added sacredness in China according
  as its foundation is on a spot originally chosen or
  honored by a representative of Heaven as a threshold
  of a place of worship. Thus Tai Shan, or the “Great
  Mount,” in the province of Shantung, China, is mentioned
  in the Shoo King, or Book of Records, as the
  site of the great Emperor Shun’s altar of sacrifice to
  Heaven, 2254 B.C., or, say, three centuries before the
  time of Abraham. On this holy mountain, as the
  earliest historic foundation of Chinese worship, “is
  the great rendezvous of devotees, every sect has there
  its temples and idols, scattered up and down its
  sides;” and great multitudes come thither to worship
  from near and far.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c012'><sup>[450]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  This idea shows itself in modern discoveries among
  the ruins of ancient Greece. It appears that when
  Pericles (437 B.C.) began his building of the new
  Propylæa on the Acropolis, he would have cleared
  away the remains of such ancient sacred structures as
  stood within its outline. “The plan of Mnesikles the
  architect was very simple, and is still clear enough,
  though it was never fully carried out.” “That the
  original plan of Mnesikles had undergone modifications
  <span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>was long ago seen by every architect who made
  the Propylæa matter of serious study.” Dr. Dörpfeld
  thinks he has discovered how the plan was modified,
  and why. The enforced departure from the original
  plan seems to have been because that plan involved
  the destruction of shrines on an earlier foundation,
  with a threshold that might not be moved. The gate
  of Cimon, with its “statue of some guardian god of
  the gate,–it may be Hermes Propylaios himself,”–was
  within that outline, and also other sacred sites.

  “Against such intrusion it is very likely the priesthood
  rose and protested, and, before even the foundations
  were laid, he had to give up, at least for the
  time, the whole of the southeast hall, and a part of
  the southwest wing.” This conclusion is the result
  of recent investigation by careful scholars, and it is in
  accordance with the ascertained fact that in primitive
  thought an original foundation for a temple or shrine
  is counted sacred for all time as the foundation there
  for such a place of worship, not to be swept away or
  ignored in any rebuilding or new building.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c012'><sup>[451]</sup></a>

  When from any reason, in early Europe, an ancient
  shrine must be removed from its primitive foundation,
  it was deemed desirable to remove to the new site a
  portion of the foundation itself, as well as the sanctuary
  or altar above that foundation. Thus, for example,
  <span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>when Thorolf of Norway, who had charge of
  the temple of Thor in Mostur, removed to Iceland in
  A.D. 833, he took with him the temple posts and
  furniture “and the very earth on which the altar of
  that idol had been erected.” And when he landed in
  Iceland, Thorolf built a new temple of Thor, with an
  altar on the foundation which he had brought from
  the earlier shrine. A thousand years after this the
  foundation-site of that second temple was still pointed
  out near Hofstad, in Iceland.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c012'><sup>[452]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>
  Bible language and narrative abound with incidental
  evidence of the commonness of this primitive idea.
  When Jacob, on his way to Haran, came to Beth-el–a
  House of God–he lighted on “the place” (<em>hammaqâm</em>)
  where,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c012'><sup>[453]</sup></a> long before, his ancestor Abraham had
  worshiped, as he came from Egypt by way of the
  Negeb.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c012'><sup>[454]</sup></a> And yet earlier Abraham himself, as he
  came a pilgrim from Haran and Ur, had there
  “builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon
  the name of the Lord.”<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c012'><sup>[455]</sup></a> And if that place were

  thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The
  restorer of paths to dwell in.”<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c012'><sup>[464]</sup></a>

  New Testament phraseology makes frequent reference
  to this same idea. “According to the grace
  which was given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I
  laid a foundation,” says Paul. “But let each man
  take heed how he buildeth thereon. For other foundation
  can no man lay than that is laid, which is
  Christ Jesus.”<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c012'><sup>[465]</sup></a> The Christian saints of the “household
  of God,” as “living stones,”<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c012'><sup>[466]</sup></a> are “built upon
  the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ
  Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; in whom
  each several building, fitly framed together, groweth
  into a holy temple in the Lord.”<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c012'><sup>[467]</sup></a>
</p>

<p class='c000'>
  Muhammadanism, which shows many survivals of
  primitive ideas and primitive customs, emphasizes the
  importance of the first foundation as the only foundation,
  in the traditions and legends of the holy places
  <span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>of its most sacred city. Every <em>masjid</em>, or “place of
  prostration,” in that vicinity is on a site counted holy
  long centuries before the days of the Prophet of Islam.

  The Kaʿbah, or Holy House, in the mosk at Meccah
  is said to have been built by Adam himself, on
  the model of a similar structure in heaven. It would
  seem as if no earthly foundation, or threshold, could
  have been earlier than that; indeed, the Qurân declares:
  “The first house appointed unto men to worship
  in was that which was in Beccah [or Meccah];”<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c012'><sup>[468]</sup></a>
  yet there is a tradition that Adam erected a place of
  prayer even before he built the Kaʿbah. In the Deluge
  the Holy House was destroyed; but Abraham was
  directed to rebuild it, and on digging beneath the surface
  of its site he discovered the original foundation,
  and the Kaʿbah was newly built up on that.

  According to Muhammadan traditions, it was while
  Hagar was near the site of the Holy House, with her
  famishing son Ishmael, that a spring of water gushed
  forth with its life-giving stream from beneath that
  holy site. And that spring is the well Zemzem, or
  Zamzam, whose waters are deemed sacred and life-giving
  to-day.

<p class='c000'>
  Mount Arafat, a holy hill near Meccah, is another
  place of pilgrimage, and its sacredness dates from even
  an earlier day than the laying of the first foundation
  <span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>of the Holy House at Meccah by Adam. When our
  first parents were cast out of their heavenly paradise,
  Adam lighted in Ceylon, and Eve in Arabia. Seeking
  each other, they met on Mount Arafat, or the Mount
  of Recognition, and therefore that spot of their reunion
  and new covenanting is a place of pilgrimage
  and worship for the faithful of all the world at this
  time.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c012'><sup>[469]</sup></a> Adam is said to have built a <em>madaa</em>, a place of
  prayer, on Mount Arafat, before he built the Kaʿbah.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c012'><sup>[470]</sup></a>
  The religion of Islam thus teaches its subjects to worship
  at the earliest threshold laid by our first parents
  in their primal covenanting, and all other religions
  recognize the importance of a similar idea.
