    <small>[75:2]</small></sup></span> <b>A psalm of Asaph. A song.</b>  
  We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, and your name is near. Your wonderful deeds are told. <br /><sup><b>2</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:3]</small></sup></span> “I will indeed set an appointed time; I will judge fairly. <br /><sup><b>3</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:4]</small></sup></span> The  earth and all its inhabitants are  shaking; I steady its columns. Selah <br /><sup><b>4</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:5]</small></sup></span> I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast!’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn! <br /><sup><b>5</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:6]</small></sup></span> Do not lift up high your horn. Do not  speak with arrogant pride.’ ” <br /><sup><b>6</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:7]</small></sup></span> For it is  not from the  east or the  west and not from the south that  lifting up comes, <br /><sup><b>7</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:8]</small></sup></span> rather God is the  judge; one he brings low, and another he lifts up. <br /><sup><b>8</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:9]</small></sup></span> For there is  a cup in the hand of Yahweh with wine that  foams, fully mixed, and he pours out from this. Surely all the wicked of the land will quaff it down to its dregs. <br /><sup><b>9</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:10]</small></sup></span> But as for me, I will proclaim forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. <br /><sup><b>10</b></sup>  <span class='text-muted'><sup><small>[75:11]</small></sup></span> “And all the  horns of the  wicked I will cut off. The  horns of the  righteous will be lifted up.” <sup><small>LEB</small></sup>
