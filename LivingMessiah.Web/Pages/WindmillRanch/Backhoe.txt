		<h5 class="card-title">Explanation of Picture</h5>

		<p class="card-text">
			The swale needs to be mapped out in a way that roughly matches the picture i.e. south of the road and east of the well (located by Boat)
			It's imperative that all of the top of the level sill's be as close to level as possible as the overflow runoff must not cause erosion

				<p>Legend:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Barbwire Fencing</b>: The red lines has most of the posts in place but the barbwire needs to be replaced,
				the pink line needs wire and posts
			</li>
			<li><b>Big Blue Arrow</b>: This is the way the water flows currently</li>
			<li><b>Green line</b>: This line represents the <b>swales</b> and a redirection of the water flow</li>
			<li>
				<b>Big Yellow Arrows</b>: This is the <b>level sills</b> and is that's where the water will flow once the swale is full.
				They need to be able to handle water flowing over them without erosion.
			</li>
			<li><b>Fence Posts:</b> P1-P5 are temporary fence posts and put at various stages so that I can take a transit and double check that the swales are level.</li>
			<li><b>Wells</b>: <i>W</i> is the working well and <i>X</i> is the well at the windmill</li>
			<li>
				<b>Silt Pond</b>: Picking up the extra water that comes from the watershed that is Northeast of the property would be beneficial.
				Adding a little pond to drop the silt and using a pipe (black arrow) to draw back into the swale would be bring in extra clean water.
			</li>
			<li><b>Black Lines</b>: The black lines at the top of the picture represent the scale of the picture...each one is 50 feet.</li>
