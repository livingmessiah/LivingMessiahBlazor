<h4><span class="badge badge-success"><b>Introduction</b></span></h4>
<p>
	For not to much effort and resources, what are the things that can be accomplished with the service of a bulldozer?
	One thing that came to mind is you can get people excited about what your trying to do and a big level by actually having things is place.
	You no longer have to articulate your permaculture goals in an abstract way, but you can actually show the physical manifestations of what you're tying to accomplish (or at least it's beginning).
	This is a big deal. We (me in particular) and not <b>selling</b> this idea very well and is what needs to be done.

			This map shows the railroad bed at the bottom left portion of picture and the main work to be done is found in the bottom right section of the picture where the swales are to be dug out.
			As the bulldozer exits off the railroad bed and makes its way to the swales I'm thinking why not make a road as it goes there and returns from there.
			This road will be a very useful not only for the Webb's but others who can use it as an alternative road.
			Placing the road on the ridge of the property may not be the direct path, but it will be easy to maintain.
			Also the first part of the road will, for the most part, mark off the western edge of the Webb's property which maybe easier to fence off.
			It doesn't need to be perfect (unless it is decided to do that) but I would think that a single pass with the blade down on one side and lifting the dirt towards the center
			and doing a similar thing on the opposite side as the dozer returns, would be sufficient.
		</p>

		<p class="card-text"><u>Directions</u></p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>North West Bound</b>. The path from off the railroad bed, represented by the <span class="text-danger">red line</span>, is to head northwest to the ridge of the hill which is pretty close to the edge of the Webb property.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>North Bound</b>. Once you have gotten to the western edge head North, almost all the way to the northern edge of the Webb property.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>East by Southeast Bound</b>. There is a cow trail / road that goes in a east southeast direction and is the best place to cross the wash.
				Follow that through all the way to where the swales will be.

			First off, more on this can be seen below in the next figure.
			The white polygon represents the area where phase 1 of the project will occur as it will directly benefit from the overflow from the swales.
			For the most part it is fairly flat so manicuring it with a bulldozer to be more consistent shouldn't be that hard.
			The goal is to have the water flow over it in sheets and not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rill">rill's</a> or worse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gully">gullies</a>.
			Taking out existing gullies and undulations along with the smaller trees and shrubs would be beneficial.
			Leaving a select few larger trees would also be beneficial as it would allow for wind breads and domesticated animals to cool off.

			The swale needs to be mapped out in a way that roughly matches the picture i.e. south of the road and east of the well (located by Boat)
			It's imperative that all of the top of the level sill's be as close to level as possible as the overflow runoff must not cause erosion

		<p>Legend:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Barbwire Fencing</b>: The red lines has most of the posts in place but the barbwire needs to be replaced, 
				the pink line needs wire and posts</li>
			<li><b>Big Blue Arrow</b>: This is the way the water flows currently</li>
			<li><b>Green line</b>: This line represents the <b>swales</b> and a redirection of the water flow</li>
			<li><b>Big Yellow Arrows</b>: This is the <b>level sills</b> and is that's where the water will flow once the swale is full.  
				They need to be able to handle water flowing over them without erosion.</li>
			<li><b>Fence Posts:</b> P1-P5 are temporary fence posts and put at various stages so that I can take a transit and double check that the swales are level.</li>
			<li><b>Wells</b>: <i>W</i> is the working well and <i>X</i> is the well at the windmill</li>
			<li><b>Silt Pond</b>: Picking up the extra water that comes from the watershed that is Northeast of the property would be beneficial.  
				Adding a little pond to drop the silt and using a pipe (black arrow) to draw back into the swale would be bring in extra clean water.</li>
			<li><b>Black Lines</b>: The black lines at the top of the picture represent the scale of the picture...each one is 50 feet.</li>

<h1><span class="badge badge-success"><b>More Bulldozer Work</b></span></h1>

<p>
	Depending on how things go and how easy other projects can be accomplished with the bulldozer, it makes sense to consider them.
	Why not leverage as much use out of a piece of equipment as you can given that the expense of getting it here is extensive.

		<p class="card-text">
			The Webb property has a big area (e.g. 1 to 2 acres) where there's a massive topsoil erosion.
			I'm thinking that if you can encircle that area with a swale and then focus the water runoff into a specific area that is designed to handle the water off-ramp is good thing.
			The ground is soft and would be easy for the dozer to build it.
			What to do with that area I have some ideas but doing the swale to prevent any further damage is low handing fruit.
		</p>

		<p class="card-text">
			The map shows a contour of where the swale could be with the red lines identifying it's edge.
			If you zoom in, you can see the cracks or fissures caused by the erosion and probably the lower right edge of the proposed swale location should be extend along that contour line.
